15.0 Employee Relations 15.1 Employees (SASB Investment Banking & Brokerage FN-IB-330a.1, Professional & Commercial Services SV.PS-330a.2, GRI 401-1, GRI 405-1) We use a strategic approach to building a diverse, inclusive, and respectful workplace.  Our HR department provides expertise and tools to attract, develop, and retain diverse talent and support our employees’ career and development goals.  We value our employees’ opinions and encourage them to engage with management and ask questions on topics such as our goals, challenges, and employee concerns.  Employees are encouraged to submit questions to our CEO and our President during our semi.annual employee meetings, either before or during the meeting. Although the semi-annual employee meetings have been suspended during the pandemic, our CEO and our President have maintained communication with our employees through regular emails and audio messages.  They also hold periodic video meetings with randomly selected manager- and director-level employees. Employee Compensation We link total compensation to our financial performance and to the attainment of our short-term and long.term strategic, operational, and financial objectives. We believe that an effective compensation program should reward employees for: • advancing our business strategies; • advancing the interests of our investors and other stakeholders; • upholding and complying with our policies, including  contributing to a discrimination-free workplace; • incentivizing compliance with our ESG policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our EHS policies; and • meeting our environmental, safety, and compliance targets.  We are committed to paying a fair wage to our employees and our pay policies help establish a living wage.  Pay is based on a thorough analysis of the market, salaries of employees in similar jobs, and applicable laws. We establish competitive pay rates with the external market and facilitate equitable pay internally for similar jobs.  Employee compensation includes competitive base salaries in the markets in which we operate and competitive benefits, including retirement plans, opportunities for annual bonuses, and, for eligible employees, long-term incentives, and an employee stock purchase plan.  In 2020, over 95% of our employees were eligible for the employee stock purchase plan.  Annual Incentive Plan Our Annual Incentive Plan is designed to foster our executive officers’ and employees’ personal stake in our continued success through the possible payment of annual cash bonuses that are dependent on a combination of individual and company performance. Under the Annual Incentive Plan, a pool of bonus dollars is budgeted at the beginning of each year for annual cash bonuses that may be paid to our executive officers and other employees, depending on the extent to which we meet certain financial performance objectives set at the beginning of the year by our Board’s Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee then establishes the final bonus pool based primarily on the extent to which the financial performance objectives are met. The Compensation Committee may also adjust the budgeted pool of bonus dollars upward or downward based on our overall performance in other areas, including targets for safety and environmental incident rates, regulatory compliance, and other financial measures. Employee Benefits We offer a variety of benefits to eligible employees, their children, spouses, domestic partners, and the children of domestic partners. These programs are described in more detail below: • PTO: Our PTO program offers employees flexibility to schedule time away from work to handle personal and family commitments. PTO hours may be used for various reasons, including but not limited to: short-term illnesses, vacations, bonding with a newborn or newly adopted or fostered child, or attending school functions. • Parental leave: Short-term disability coverage is available to new mothers for the birth of a child.  Eligible employees receive up to 100% pay based on years of service for six or eight weeks. • Flexible work schedules: Flexible starting and ending work times, and reduced schedules are options to help manage work/life balance. • Variable work schedules: The 9/80 work schedule gives employees the opportunity to have every other Friday off by adding an additional hour to eight of the nine workdays in the pay period.  Half-day off workweeks provide the option to work nine hours each day Monday through Thursday and four hours on Friday of each week.  • Hybrid work schedule: On a trial basis, eligible employees have the ability to participate in a work-from-home pilot up to two days a week on non-core office days. • Bereavement leave: Three days paid time off for the death of an immediate family member. • Military leave: Actively serving employees are paid the difference between their KMI pay and their active military pay for up to two years. • Disability leave: Sick or injured employees who are unable to work for more than seven consecutive days may be eligible for short-term disability leave.  Employees on an approved leave can receive up to 100% of pay for up to 26 weeks based on years of service. • Tuition reimbursement: Up to $5,250 per calendar year. • Financial support: Employees may apply for disaster relief grants if they suffer an emergency hardship as a result of certain natural disasters and live in a state or county with a major disaster declaration. Wellness Initiatives Our Wellness 360° program provides a holistic approach to wellness for our employees and their eligible dependents, focusing not only on physical well-being, but emotional and financial health as well.  Participants are able to access helpful resources designed to support a healthy lifestyle such as a behavioral science-based weight loss program, a flexible fitness program membership, and monthly webinars related to physical, mental, and financial health among many others. Positive Employee Relations Program In 2012, our Tax department created the Positive Employee Relations program.  This program has been active over the past nine years and through various initiatives has fostered a culture of inclusivity and promoted professional and personal growth within the Tax Department.  An important part of the program is volunteering in the community, for example, fundraising for the Houston Food Bank and Hurricane Harvey recovery. In 2020, the program was maintained virtually through weekly social hours with team building activities and milestone celebrations.  Employees also continued to independently contribute to their local communities. Employee and Board of Directors Composition The number of full-time, part-time, and temporary employees; voluntary and involuntary turnover rates; and composition of our workforce by age, gender, disability status, and minority representation are provided below.

Excludes employees in Mexico. (k) Includes count of employee-initiated voluntary terminations from full and part-time employment.  Excludes retirees. Our company underwent an organizational effectiveness and efficiency program in 2020, which resulted in the consolidation and centralization of many of our cross-business segment functions, including Environmental, Project Management, Integrity Management, and Engineering Services.  In addition to seeking cost efficiencies, the aim of the program was to achieve greater organizational effectiveness by bringing our experts together and instituting best practices across the organization. As part of the program, we made the decision to offer some of our employees the opportunity to express a preference for voluntary separation from our company. This allowed us to minimize involuntary reductions in our workforce by considering employee preference and providing greater clarity on the path forward for our new organizational structure. Employees opting to partake in the voluntary separation program were offered outplacement services if requested, full and immediate vesting of any outstanding long-term equity grants, as well as severance pay not received in a normal voluntary departure or retirement.  These same benefits were also offered to employees that were involuntarily separated due to this program.  15.2 Diversity and Inclusion We consider employee diversity an asset and support equal opportunity employment.  We take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment all persons without regard to their race/ethnicity; sex; sexual orientation; gender, including gender identity and expression; veteran status; disability; or other protected categories, and base employment decisions solely on valid job requirements. We prohibit discrimination or harassment against any employee or applicant on the basis of race, gender, or other protected categories listed in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  We are committed to a harassment free workplace, supported with online and face-to-face workplace harassment and discrimination prevention training for our employees. Employees and supervisors review our Harassment and Discrimination Prevention policy every two years as part of our HR Policy Renewal training.  Diversity Initiatives We seek to engage with a broad range of candidates for open positions and undertake initiatives such as active participation in veteran and other jobs fairs aimed at increasing diversity representation in our workplace. Additionally, we partner with organizations whose focus is providing employment opportunities, including apprenticeships and internships, for minority candidates.  • Board Oversight As part of our annual succession planning process, we identify minority and female candidates to include in the plan for senior positions. We review our succession plan, including a discussion on development opportunities for potential successors, with the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors. • Board Diversity The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for advising our Board on matters of diversity. Over time, our Board’s intention is to decrease the size and enhance the gender and racial diversity of our Board. • Executive Leadership In July 2020, our CEO added a leadership expectation for our President, COO, business segment presidents, General Counsel, CFO, VP of Government Relations and Communications, CAO, and VP of Corporate Development to establish a plan for enhancing diversity and equality of opportunity in hiring, development, and promotion decisions. These expectations are discussed and reinforced during the annual performance review process.  Currently, 42% of our executive leadership is female or a minority. • Seeking Diverse Applicants We use the services of a major job posting board with over 1,000 diversity partners including companies and organizations that specifically target and attract women, minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities. We also partner with a job-delivery company as part of our commitment to post job openings with local employment offices and community-based organizations that focus on women, minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities. Some of the websites for these organizations include: • Hire a Hero, • Job Opportunities for Disabled American Veterans, • RecruitABILITY, and • U.S. Diversity. To increase our opportunities to recruit minority and female job candidates, we have identified contingency search firms and job-posting sites for broadening and diversifying our job applicant pool, such as: • Women in Technology, • Society of Women Engineers, • National Society of Black Engineers, and • Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. Military veterans have tools and skills that translate into what we do every day.  We value the leadership, drive, discipline, and strong work ethic that is developed in the military.  We are committed to providing opportunities to veterans and do so by building partnerships with military-focused recruiting companies and attending job fairs that focus on placing veterans.  In 2020, that included the Warrior for Life Luncheon, NextOps, and Military and Veteran Success Center 3rd Annual Veteran and Community Job Fair. • Hiring Process In order to promote a more diverse workforce, we have enacted certain practices that we believe makes our hiring process more inclusive and helps promote the hiring of talent regardless of an applicant’s gender, ethnicity, or other status. We strive to have a diverse candidate pool for consideration for our job openings. To help eliminate bias during interviews, we aim to select interview panels that have diversity representation. • Employing Locally We recognize the importance of hiring locally and benefiting the economies of those communities in which we operate.  We post our job openings to a variety of organizations’ job boards including local employment offices, veteran’s offices, colleges and universities, and vocational rehabilitation centers. In addition to job postings, we also attend local job fairs to hire talent from the communities in which we operate. We are one of the major employers in many smaller communities and we provide local talent with rewarding, well-paying jobs that allow employees to build a career within the energy industry. • Internship and Work Study Programs We are a partner with the Genesys Works program in Houston, Texas.  Genesys Works is a non.profit organization that provides meaningful corporate internships to local high school students from underserved communities, primarily serving minority students.  In 2020, we had six motivated, high-potential students from the Genesys Works program engaged in an internship with us.  During their internships, students are able to develop business skills, gain professional work experience, and create a plan for a successful future. We are a partner with the Cristo Rey Jesuit Work-Study Program. Cristo Rey Jesuit is a private high school offering a rigorous college preparatory education to young people of limited economic resources who live in Houston. Approximately 95% of Cristo Rey students are racial minorities.  The program places students in Houston businesses where they earn up to 50% of the cost of their education and develop and hone social and technical skills in the workplace.  In 2020, we had eight students participating in this work-study program. Building Opportunities and Learning Together is a successful paid internship program for college students. This 11- to 12-week program provides our interns with an opportunity to use their newly gained skills on a challenging project.  Each student is assigned a mentor and supervisor who guides them throughout their internship. Supervisors are responsible for determining project scope and conducting periodic evaluations of their intern’s progress. At the end of the program, interns make presentations on their project, that includes recommendations, to their business segment management, peers, and HR. For our 2021 summer internship program we partnered with INROADS to increase minority and female representation in the program. We also partnered with San Jacinto College on an apprenticeship program that focuses on IT-related roles and the Energy Education Center to educate diverse high school students about our industry.  We expect to draw from such Energy Education Center students for future internship opportunities at our company once they have completed their freshman year of college. • Leadership Training We have updated our internal leadership training programs, described in Section 15.3 Human Capital Development Programs of our Sustainability Report, to incorporate more diversity and inclusion content. 15.3 Human Capital Development Programs (GRI 102-12, GRI 401-2, GRI 404-1, GRI 404-2) Our employees are an integral part of our success, and we value their career development.  We encourage and support professional development and learning for our employees by offering workforce training, tuition reimbursement, and other development programs.  These programs help improve recruitment, development, and retention. In an effort to promote an open feedback culture, we engage with our employees through cross business segment teams, focus groups, and a third-party administered confidential survey.  In 2020, 65% of our Houston based employees participated in a third-party administered survey that helped gauge workplace satisfaction and engagement. Results from our employee engagement activities provide us insight into employee satisfaction and help us develop strategies to more effectively engage with our team members.  As an example, the results led us to develop updated vision and mission statements in 2019 to reaffirm our direction as a company, what we want to accomplish, and why what we do matters. We support our employees’ ongoing career goals and development through several programs.  These programs help maximize our employees’ potential and give them the skills they need to further enhance their careers. New Employee On-boarding Orientation Program We understand that developing our employees’ skills starts from day one.  New employees participate in an orientation program designed to help them: • learn more about our company, • understand processes and goals for their new positions, and • locate the internal resources available to help them succeed. Performance Review Program Employee performance reviews are conducted to maximize employee productivity and provide development feedback. Our performance review program allows employees to receive a timely and objective review of their job performance at least once a year. New Supervisor Training - CORE Leadership Our CORE Leadership Training program is for newly promoted or hired leaders to successfully make the transition from an individual contributor to a first-time leader.  In 2020, 82 leaders successfully completed the program.  This leadership development course takes a blended approach to learning, including: • online learning activities, • monthly virtual conference call roundtables to reinforce desired behaviors, and • follow-up by participants’ leaders. The program focuses on the knowledge and skills we believe are core to being an effective leader and takes approximately six months to complete, with a time commitment of two to four hours per month. High-Potential Employee Training - Emerging Leaders Institute Our Emerging Leaders Institute is an internal two-year leadership-development training program designed to develop leadership bench strength. Employees who are nominated to participate in this program develop leadership skills, business acumen, and advanced presentation skills.  Due to COVID-19, the program was paused in 2020 and 2021. The Next Level Training Program Our Next Level program is based on the concept of leaders developing leaders and is provided to employees transitioning from director-level roles to vice presidents.  This program focuses on the skills needed to transition between these roles and its content includes: • discussions with senior leadership, • self-assessments, and • development planning. Total Employee Training Hours In addition to health, safety, emergency response, and other safety topics, we provide employee development training on topics including: • corporate policies, • environmental protection, • leadership and management, • on the job skills, and • software and IT systems. The total hours spent on employee development training are provided below. Year Ended December 31 2018 2019 2020 (In thousands) Total hours of employee development training(a)(b)(c)  Natural Gas Pipelines  95  101  214  Products Pipelines  26  26  69  Terminals  55  83  47  CO2  9  9  4  Kinder Morgan Canada(d)  15  —  —  Corporate  11  9  17  Total 211 228 351 (a) Training time is assigned to the business segment the employeewas active under at the end of the calendar year. (b) Includes the U.S. portion of the Cochin Pipeline and KML data up to the sale date on December 16, 2019. (c) Excludes operator qualification for years 2018 and 2019. (d) Represents Kinder Morgan Canada employee average training time up to the date of the TMPL sale on August 31, 2018. In addition to our investments in health, safety, and emergency response training, we invested roughly $20 million in other employee development training in 2020, or about $1,900 per full time employee.  Together with health, safety, and emergency response training we have invested approximately $27 million, or about $2,600 per employee.33 Tuition Reimbursement We offer our full-time employees a tuition reimbursement program that gives employees the opportunity to complete college level courses that encourage and support career growth. 33 This is calculated by multiplying our total training hours by our employees’ hourly median salary, calculated from the annual employee median salary disclosed in our 2021 Proxy Statement. Relocation Assistance We provide relocation assistance to eligible employees to provide career development opportunities that may become available at our other locations. 16.0 Community Relations 16.1 Processes to Manage Risks and Opportunities Associated with Community Rights and Interests (SASB Exploration & Production EM-EP-210b.1, GRI 413-1) Our neighbors, communities, and local governments play an important role in how we conduct our business. We live, work, and play in these communities. Our policies are designed to facilitate our building trust and fostering collaboration within the communities in which we operate, including our commitment to: • community engagement, • respect, • transparency and responsiveness, • negotiate in good faith, • training, • fairness, and • responsible construction. We engage our leadership and deploy resources to help us fulfill these requirements.  Our internal Corporate Communications and Public Affairs department helps develop and implement our community relations strategies to reach a variety of stakeholders identified through stakeholder mapping.  Our internal community consultation guidelines recognize that it is important to identify project stakeholders, determine and monitor their needs and expectations, and then work with them on meeting those needs and expectations as appropriate. In addition, project-specific team members help fulfill our commitment to communicate and work with communities in an effort to build trust and foster collaboration.  Our Public Affairs team provides insights, guidance, and resources to operations and project-specific employees. As described in Section 6.1 Environmental Management Policies and Practices for Active Operations of the Sustainability Report, we take our local stakeholders’ concerns and feedback into consideration during the development of our growth projects and follow our construction and mitigative procedures that take into account plans to minimize impacts to nearby residents. This process helps address potential issues prior to the start of construction. During construction we also consult with stakeholders directly affected by our operations. This dialogue is intended to help us resolve issues as they arise or, better still, prevent issues from arising in the first place.  Information about the additional ways we engage with stakeholders is described in Section 16.1.1 Stakeholder Engagement and Consultation Mechanisms of the Sustainability Report. We participate in industry trade associations to further communicate the benefits of our customers’ products and our services. We serve on communications committees where we assist in the development of communication materials that address topics such as: • safety, • construction, • restoration activities, • environmental considerations, and • the social and economic benefits of the industry. For more information, see our Community Relations Policy at https://www.kindermorgan.com/ WWWKM/media/Documents/Community_Relations_Policy.pdf. 16.1.1 Stakeholder Engagement and Consultation Mechanisms (GRI 102-21, GRI 102-43) We strive to build and maintain healthy relationships throughout the areas where we operate.  Many of our Community Relations Policy commitments are accomplished through ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. We have helped develop, establish, and promote industry best practices for stakeholder engagement.  We are committed to making stakeholder engagement a priority on our projects. For certain new projects, our Corporate Communications and Public Affairs department develops a project-specific outreach and stakeholder engagement plan and timeline to notify stakeholders early about the project and to open and establish lines of communication. We respond to stakeholder feedback on each project and incorporate that feedback into the project planning process, including community engagement and community development planning. We offer stakeholders a variety of ways to contact us about major growth projects, such as project specific: • toll-free phone numbers, • email addresses, • websites, • public meetings, and • in-person meetings. Throughout a project’s timeline, our personnel may interact with a wide array of stakeholders, including: • elected officials, • media outlets, • landowners, • local citizens groups, • indigenous peoples, • protesters, and • other members of the public. We have systems in place for communicating with these different interest groups and training in place for project employees and contractors to prepare them for interactions with varying audiences.  Initial project briefings and training sessions educate employees and contractors on communication procedures and resources. This training also provides: • an overview of our company, • an overview of the project, and • the project’s purpose and benefits. The training reiterates the importance of being a good neighbor in the communities where the project is located. We also provide instructions for accessing relevant project personnel when needed to respond to specific stakeholder questions. A summary of the ways we regularly engage and consult with stakeholders is provided below, including in the stages before, during, and after the construction of projects. Government and Landowners Community Members Emergency Responders Regulators Town halls and open houses Town halls and open houses In-person meetings Regulatory filings On-line emergency Public policy and legislative In-person meetings In-person meetings responder training issue engagement Home and site visits Project websites Facility tours Industry group involvement Emergency response Project websites Social media Facility tours tabletops and exercises Social media Community investment The Responder E-newsletter In-person meetings programs Public awareness Employee volunteer projects Emergency Response Plans communications Partnerships with local and Public awareness regional organizations communications For our larger projects, we often also create project-specific websites.  We provide contact information on our webpage where stakeholders can obtain further information if they have a question or concern about a projects’ development or operation. 16.1.1.1 Public Awareness Program Keeping our communities safe is of utmost importance and we use our Public Awareness Program to keep local stakeholders informed about pipeline safety. Our Public Awareness Program is designed to: • create public awareness about pipelines in the areas where we operate, • provide important safety information to people living and working near our pipelines, • increase knowledge of the regulations for working around pipelines, • prevent damage to our pipelines, • educate first responders and the public on our emergency preparedness response activities, and • enhance public safety. Our program was developed under federal pipeline safety regulation consultation guidelines.34 Our program is an example of our ongoing stakeholder consultations in which we engage with, provide information to, and receive feedback from our stakeholders. As part of our outreach plans, we target communications to the following stakeholder groups: • residents, • business owners, • farmers and ranchers, • schools, • contractors, and • government officials. 34 DOT-PHMSA. “Public Awareness Programs: API RP 1162.” DOT-PHMSA, Dec. 2003. 2021. <https:// primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/PublicAwareness/PARPI1162.htm>. Our program advocates pipeline safety and safe digging practices to the public through multiple avenues, including: • brochures; • newsletters; • newspaper, magazine, radio, and television advertisements; • direct mail; • social media; • direct contact; and • our website at https://www.kindermorgan.com/Safety-Environment/Public-Awareness/Index. We tailor the type, language, and formatting of our communications to the target audience, message to be delivered, and best practices for the selected medium. To manage our program’s engagement strategy, we maintain a Public Awareness Program evaluation plan that includes measures for evaluating effectiveness. For example, we track our stakeholder engagement interactions and our responses to requests for information. On average, we receive over 300 requests for information about our assets each year. We also receive requests for training and safety information from emergency responders. To assess the effectiveness of our program, we conduct public awareness surveys.  We evaluate whether our public awareness actions are achieving the following intended goals and objectives: • information is reaching the intended stakeholder audiences; • recipient audiences understand the messages being delivered; • recipients are motivated to respond appropriately in alignment with the information provided; and • the program is impacting the underlying intended results, such as reduction in the number of incidents caused by third-party damage. We also conduct audits to assess the program and identify program improvements and changes. We place a high value on public safety and seek to educate the public to increase their: • awareness of pipeline locations, • understanding of potential hazards from an unintentional release, and • ability to identify and respond to a potential release. In addition to our Public Awareness Program, our project-specific emergency response plans detail how to communicate with external stakeholders to more effectively resolve potential concerns quickly and safely. For more information about our Public Awareness Program, see our website at https:// www.kindermorgan.com/Safety-Environment/Public-Awareness/Index. For more information about our Responder E-newsletter, see our website at https:// www.kindermorgan.com/Safety-Environment/Public-Awareness/The-Responder. 16.2 Social Investment Programs (GRI 102-12, GRI 201-1, GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2) We are committed to giving back to the communities in which we operate.  We actively look for opportunities for our employees to get involved in community programs and strengthen their relationships with our stakeholders. Connect.Inspire.Give In 2018 we launched a redesigned volunteer program that includes additional volunteer opportunities in the local community, including collection drives for school supplies, toys, pet food, and other community needs. Our volunteer program schedule includes many diverse events such as: • fun runs benefiting non-profits, • repairing homes for the elderly and disadvantaged, • working at a food pantry, • restoring parks and trails, • feeding the homeless community, and • working with Special Olympics athletes. The goal of our program is to enable employees to connect with each other across various departments, learn more about their communities, improve morale, and develop new skills while working toward the common goal of improving peoples’ lives.  For example, in 2020, we were part of a multi-organizational effort to host the Charlton-Pollard Trash Bash, where our employees contributed to the removal of nearly 1,500 pounds of trash in a Beaumont, Texas neighborhood.  We hope that the organizations we support through these efforts inspire employees to give their time, talent, and donations. Community Investments We are committed to investing in the communities in which we operate.  We budget funds annually to distribute to community organizations and initiatives across our business segments and operating regions.  The community organizations receiving these contributions typically fit into one of the following categories: • public safety and emergency response, • children’s educational or athletic programs, or • environmental sustainability and education. We also have made contributions to local organizations supporting recovery efforts from natural disasters. In addition to the community investments made on behalf of the business segments, we also make community investments in areas where major growth projects are proposed or under construction. Recipient organizations are identified in coordination with local stakeholders in the project area including elected officials and local NGOs. Below are some of the organizations to which we contributed in 2020: • Blanco County Services - donated funds to county road repairs and maintenance and to the Peyton Colony School Trust • Fredericksburg School District and Fire Department - donated a learning lab and renovations at Stonewall Elementary School • Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago - supported local Girl Scout Troops Kinder Morgan Foundation The Kinder Morgan Foundation’s mission is to provide today’s youth with opportunities to learn and grow in order to become tomorrow’s leaders.  The Foundation’s primary goal is to help today’s science, math and music students become the engineers, educators, and musicians who could support our diverse communities for many years to come. The Foundation provides donations through four types of programs, including: • Kinder Morgan Foundation grants, • Employee gift matching, • Disaster relief assistance, and • United Way employee gift matching. These programs are described in more detail below. Kinder Morgan Foundation Grant Program The Kinder Morgan Foundation grant program focuses exclusively on academic education and the arts. These grants support programs that benefit under-served youth, with a focus on minorities and girls, and a majority of the contributions are directed to STEM programs.  The Kinder Morgan Foundation’s target is to donate more than $1 million to qualifying 501(c)(3) organizations in the U.S. each year. In 2019, the grant program was updated to target communities in select locations across the U.S. that are densely populated, include high concentrations of our employees and customers, and were in close proximity to our main offices.  In 2020, the Kinder Morgan Foundation issued grants to 97 organizations that provide educational, arts, and cultural programs.  These organizations originally estimated that they could collectively serve approximately 2.1 million students, although the actual number of students served may have been less due to the pandemic.  The contributions provided by the Kinder Morgan Foundation are typically used to provide direct support to a specified number of students or as general funding for the organization to support activities throughout the donation year.  The grants ranged from $5,000 to $20,000 per qualifying organization. Employee Gift Matching Program The Kinder Morgan Foundation also funds our Employee Matching Gift Program.  This program matches gifts made to university foundations, kindergarten through 12th grade education foundations, non-profits that support arts and culture, and STEM education programs benefiting underserved youth, such as minorities and females, in primary and secondary schools.  Our full-time employees are eligible to designate up to three employee matching grants to be donated to qualifying organizations, totaling a maximum of $2,000 per calendar year.  Disaster Relief Program The Kinder Morgan Foundation provides disaster relief assistance to organizations when natural disasters significantly impacts our operations or employees.  These funds are awarded based on the size and scale of the disaster and the needs assessed by local operations.  In 2018, 2019, and 2020, the Foundation donated to the Greater Houston Community Foundation for recovery efforts related to Hurricane Florence, Tropical Storm Imelda, and Hurricane Laura, respectively.  Additionally, in 2020, we contributed $250,000 to COVID-19 response and recovery programs across the U.S. United Way Employee Gift Matching Program The Kinder Morgan Foundation matches 50% of each employee’s donation made during the company’s annual United Way campaigns. The Kinder Morgan Foundation donations, employee donations, and corporate and project-related community investments are provided below. Year Ended December 31 2018 2019 2020 (In thousands) Kinder Morgan Foundation donations  Grants  $  1,030  $  1,084  $  782  Employee Matching(a)  105  103  114  Disaster Relief  87  83  326  United Way(a)  135  111  224  Subtotal  1,357  1,381  1,446  Employee donations(b)  374  326  562  Community investments  Donations made to Native American tribes(c)  255  262  266  Other community investments  337  254  1,696  Subtotal  592  516  1,962  Total  $  1,949  $  1,897  $  3,408  (a) These are donations made by the Kinder Morgan Foundation and do not include employee contributions. (b) Employee donations include donations made through the employee matching program and to the United Way. (c) Scholarships made to Native American tribes are for the calendar year applicable, per the grant agreement. 17.0 Human Rights and Rights of Indigenous Peoples 17.1 Human Rights (SASB Exploration & Production EM-EP-210a.3, GRI 408-1, GRI 409-1) We conduct our business consistent with the human rights philosophy expressed in the International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles. We believe supporting fundamental human rights to be a basic responsibility in conducting our business. We support the United Nations Global Compact Human Rights Principles, derived from the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which are: • Principle 1: businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, and • Principle 2: businesses should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. We prohibit the use of child labor or forced labor in our operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  Our employees and contractors, with the exception of some interns, must be at least 18 years of age. We also recognize and respect our employees’ and suppliers’ rights to join associations for the purpose of collective bargaining in a manner that is consistent with laws, rules, regulations, and customs. Our employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, vendors, and business partners are expected to: • treat people with dignity, • respect human rights, • adhere to standards of conduct consistent with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics when conducting company-related business activities, and • adhere to our Human Rights Statement. Within the areas of our activity and influence, we are committed to: • being attentive to concerns raised by stakeholders, • working with stakeholders to support human rights, and • providing remedies to correct negative human rights impacts. For more information, see our Human Rights Statement at https://www.kindermorgan.com/WWWKM/ media/Documents/Human_Rights_Statement.pdf. 17.2 Rights of Indigenous Peoples (SASB Exploration & Production EM-EP-210a.3) We respect the diversity of culture and unique history of Indigenous Peoples.  We strive to build long-term relationships and commercial partnerships with Indigenous Peoples through meaningful engagement based on mutual respect. In the course of our projects and operations, we conduct business with Indigenous Peoples consistent with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our Indigenous Peoples Policy.  We recognize the legal and constitutional protected rights of Indigenous Peoples. We engage in good faith with community members while communicating and cooperating with affected Indigenous Peoples.  We are committed to: • participating in good faith engagement; • continuing to partner with community members in suitable employment opportunities, as well as education, commercial, and community development opportunities; • identifying opportunities to support youth, education, culture, and the environment; and • negotiating in good faith with indigenous and government entities. Listening & Responding We strive to operate and grow in a socially and environmentally responsible way.  We work to establish positive interactive relationships with Indigenous Peoples who have, or claim to have, an ancestral interest in lands affected by our operations or projects.  We communicate early and often with these affected Indigenous groups and National tribal experts. We listen to and engage with Indigenous Peoples through one-on-one, group, and public meetings. In 2020, we worked with a federally recognized tribe on a portion of our PHP project right-of-way that crossed ancestral tribal lands. After listening to the concerns of the tribe, we invited tribal members to serve as Monitors during the construction process and to help oversee the protection of the tribe’s ancestral land. Right-of-way Renewals We have a long history of working with Indigenous groups when renewing right-of-way grants.  These renewals occur approximately every 20 years. We understand that the needs of Indigenous members and organizations change over time, so we begin our renegotiations for right-of-way renewals approximately 18 to 24 months in advance of expiration. During negotiations, we engage with: • current Tribal leaders, • Tribal heads of Operations, • Tribal Engineering, • Tribal Finance, • Tribal Legal, • Bureau of Indian Affairs liaison, and • other Tribal representatives the Tribe deems appropriate. Open Houses One of the primary ways we meet with and listen to communities, including Indigenous Peoples, that may be impacted by one of our projects, is by holding project open houses.  Open houses are publicized locally, and we encourage individuals or groups with an interest in our projects to attend these meetings. Walk the Route During planning for certain projects, we invite the members of Indigenous groups, with interests in a specific project, to walk the project site or route with us to identify anything of special interest to their specific Indigenous group. For the interests identified, we have meaningful consultation with the affected Indigenous group to listen to the history and importance of the matters identified and agree on the best path forward. These matters may include: • insects, birds, and animals; • plants; • sacred sites, including stone formations, and; • historical and cultural resources. Employment and Community Development For our projects, we work to meet or exceed compliance with the respective Tribal Employment Rights Ordinances and Native American Preference law in offering Indigenous community members employment opportunities as available. We also meet with Tribal leaders to discuss other possible educational, commercial, and community development opportunities. Over the past three years, we have donated over $783,000 to Native American tribes with whom we do business.  These contributions include scholarships and donations to local fire departments.  Our donation amounts to these tribes are included in Section 16.2 Social Investment Programs of the Sustainability Report.  Maintaining Relationships We maintain positive, long-term relationships even after a project is in service or right-of-way renewals have been finalized. We achieve this by: • holding public awareness and first responder meetings in Indigenous communities, • having Tribal representatives meet with our executives and visit our facilities, • making presentations to Tribal classrooms on our energy business, • participating in Tribal Feast Day events, and • awarding scholarships as provided in right-of-way agreements. Public Participation in Indigenous Matters Our employees are participants in industry conferences, Bureau of Indian Affairs conferences, and Tribal Organization conferences. We not only attend these events, but also participate as speakers and panel members. We also consult regularly on matters affecting National Tribal law and practices. For more information on how we build long-term relationships and commercial partnerships with Indigenous Peoples, see our Indigenous Peoples Policy. For an example of how we operationalize our Indigenous Peoples Policy, see our Respecting Indigenous Peoples and Communities case study video and fact sheet at https://www.kindermorgan.com/Safety-Environment/ESG. This policy and case study demonstrate our commitment to the social, economic, and cultural rights of Indigenous Peoples, reflecting the spirit of the ILO Convention 169 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

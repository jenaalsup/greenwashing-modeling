OUR SAFETY PERFORMANCE
•	We educate our employees on the applicable regulatory and company environmental health and safety (EHS) requirements as well as the elements of our Safety Management System.
•	We perform job hazard assessments and pre-job briefings prior to each work activity to ensure risks are mitigated and that all members of the work party understand the job at hand. 
•	We conduct management-led field observations to improve the effectiveness of our field leaders by increasing field presence, coaching and mentoring of front-line workers and capturing data to improve safe work behaviors.
•	Our Safety Management System captures information associated with all injury events, unsafe conditions and near misses. This information then drives a heightened level of safety responsibility and prevention among employees, supervisors and managers.
•	We train employees on advanced incident investigation techniques and root cause identification. These investigations help to determine employee, management and system failures and then prompt the user to identify and assign appropriate corrective actions to prevent incident recurrence.  
•	We benefit from employee participation in our safety committees, which are made up of both frontline and supervisory employees that review and address our work-related risks and incidents.
•	We train our employees in peer-to-peer coaching to successfully address unsafe behaviors before an injury, accident or near-miss occurs.DIVERSITY AND EQUITY At Clearway Energy Group LLC, we are committed to maintaining a workplace that acknowledges, encourages, and values diversity and inclusion.

We are dedicated to growing and expanding the knowledge base of our employees and helping them develop professionally through both voluntary and assigned training opportunities. We’ve developed a learning management system to assign and track training based on employee start date and annual training requirements to ensure all employees have the skills necessary to do their job and have opportunities to refresh those skills in a timely manner. In 2019, our training department issued more than 26,500 learning assignments to our nearly 600 employees with a 95 percent completion rate. In keeping with our commitment to continuous improvement, we use annual surveys and input from our training committee to continue to adapt our training program to fit the needs of our customers and ensure compliance with regulatory agencies in areas such as safety, protecting the environment, legal and human resource issues, and technical topics. In addition, we offer a range of programs to enhance employees’ skills in topics like management, leadership, and communication. Frontline Leadership 1.0 This two-day program is designed for new or potential managers and covers topics that include leveraging your leadership style (DiSC), active listening, delegating and setting expectations, giving effective feedback, and coaching for performance. In 2019, 38 Clearway employees participated in the program. Frontline Leadership 2.0This program is intended to sharpen and expand the skill set of new managers, and involves third-party training on emotional intelligence, coaching and teambuilding, communicating with tact and diplomacy, and leading through change. In 2019, 29 Clearway employees participated in the program. Plant Manager Development ProgramThis program is designed for new managers, supervisors, or anyone interested in moving to a management role. Each participant is assigned a mentor who takes them through several learning objectives to help them understand our operating principles, HR policies, and management responsibilities. In 2019, 20 Clearway employees (ten participants and ten mentors) took part in the program.The Clearway ExperienceLaunched in 2019, the Clearway Experience is an internal conference in which a small group of individuals from all functional groups, offices and facilities come together in person to build connections. 55 employees participated in the 2019 Clearway Experience, including the 17-member leadership team. The leadership team gave presentations on Clearway’s strategic goals, and the other attendees gave three roundtable presentations on a process, a product or a cultural improvement idea. We are currently working to implement some of the ideas that emerged from the roundtables, including a volunteer days program, an adopt-a-school program, and training on advanced features of software programs like Teams, Outlook and Zoom. We look forward to the 2020 Clearway Experience, which is scheduled for October.

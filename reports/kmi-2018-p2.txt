3.0 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 3.1 Gross Global Scope 1 and 2 Emissions We anticipate publicly reporting our Company-wide GHG Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions beginning in 2021. Our current U.S. GHG emissions reporting infrastructure is designed primarily to meet the requirements of the EPA GHGRP, Natural Gas STAR Program, and Methane Challenge Program.  We are currently developing the additional processes, procedures, information technology systems, personnel, and controls necessary to expand our emissions reporting infrastructure to meet the SASB Midstream Standard. Before reporting publicly, we plan to conduct pre-assurance readiness testing using the standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  We intend to address observations and significant recommendations resulting from the pre-assurance readiness testing before issuing our public report. Over the past year, we have made progress in expanding our U.S. and Mexico GHG emissions reporting infrastructure to address additional sources, including: • establishing GHG protocols outlining the calculation methodologies for our Scope 1 and 2 emission sources, • establishing internal roles and responsibilities for GHG data collection and compilation, and • conducting a gap analysis of our fleet vehicle and electricity usage databases. Our Canadian operations have the processes, procedures, personnel, and controls necessary to report GHG Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.  This data is included in Section 3.2 KML Gross Global Scope 1 and 2 Emissions, Percentage Methane, Percentage Covered under Emissions-Limiting Regulations. 3.2 KML Gross Global Scope 1 and 2 Emissions, Percentage Methane, Percentage Covered under Emissions-Limiting Regulations (SASB Midstream EM-MD-110a.1, SASB Exploration & Production EM-EP-110a.1, SASB Refining & Marketing EM-RM-110a.1, GRI 305-1, CDP C6.1 & 6.3, CDP C7.3 & 7.6, CDP C7.9, CDP C8.1-8.2f) Kinder Morgan Canada Limited is KMI’s publicly held Canadian subsidiary, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “KML.” KML’s significantly smaller scale relative to KMI makes its GHG emissions more readily measurable than KMI’s, which is why KML’s GHG emissions are available to be included in our Report and KMI’s are not.  KML generates Scope 1 direct GHG emissions from various sources related to pipeline and terminal operations and Scope 2 indirect GHG emissions from electricity consumption. GHG emissions, including methane, are calculated using the methodologies outlined in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.1 KML’s gross global Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions data are provided below. Year Ended December 31 2016 2017 2018 (In metric tons CO2e, except percentages) KML gross global Scope 1 emissions from continuingoperations(a)(b) (by business segment) Pipelines 400 406 318 15,969 15,715Terminals 9,469 Total KML gross global Scope 1 emissions from 9,869 16,375 16,033continuing operations 5,636 6,003KML gross global Scope 1 emissions from discontinued 4,779 operations(c) KML gross global Scope 1 emissions including discontinued 14,648 22,011 22,036operations KML gross global Scope 1 emissions from continuingoperations(b)(d) (by type of emission) Flared Hydrocarbons 0 0 0 16,179 15,914Other Combustion(e) 9,677 Process Emissions — — — Other Vented Emissions 192 196 94 Fugitive Emissions from Operations  —  —  25  Total KML gross global Scope 1 emissions fromcontinuing operations  9,869  16,375  16,033  Percentage covered under emissions-limiting regulations fromcontinuing operations(b)  0%  0%  0%  Percentage methane from continuing operations(b)(f)  2%  1%  1%  1 World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.” World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

Annual emissions are reported for CO2, CH4, and N2O from direct and indirect sources. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2013) GWPs were used to convert CH4 and N2O emissions to equivalent emissions of CO2 (CO2e). A GWP of 28 was used for CH4. A GWP of 265 was used for N2O. Gross emissions are GHGs emitted to the atmosphere before accounting for GHG reduction activities, offsets, or other adjustments for activities in the reporting period that have reduced or compensated for emissions. (b) Subject to KML shareholder and regulatory approvals, KML is expected to be sold in the fourth quarter of 2019 or first quarter 2020. (c) Represents emissions from the TMPL, Puget Sound pipeline system, and Kinder Morgan Canada Inc. sold on August 31, 2018, and presented here as discontinued operations.

The products handled by KML generally contain little to no methane. (g) Scope 2 emissions were calculated using a location-based method. (h) The Scope 1 emission intensity metric normalizes total Scope 1 methane emissions to annual throughput. Annual throughput information was converted to BOE using product heat content to provide a common denominator.  Heat content used are in MMBtu per barrel: natural gasoline/condensate - 4.62, propane - 3.836, diesel fuel - 5.838, jet fuel - 5.67, and ethanol - 3.259. Conversion calculation is barrels of product multiplied by MMBtu per barrel (product heat content) divided by 5.8 MMBtu per barrel (Barrel Oil Equivalent). KML’s largest source of Scope 1 GHG emissions from continuing operations was from vapor control operations in our Terminals business segment which increased from 2016 to 2017 due to increased operations and decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to reduced natural gas usage. Natural gas is used in the vapor control operations to assist in the combustion of vapor hydrocarbons from rail car loading operations. KML’s Scope 2 GHG emissions from continuing operations were indirect emissions from electricity consumption. From 2017 to 2018, KML’s Scope 2 emissions decreased primarily due to a drop in electricity consumption at the Pipelines business segment pump stations due to the completion of a power reduction project. A third party verified our 2016 and 2017 KML emissions inventory following the ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse Gases - Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions standard. Another third party provided limited assurance of our 2018 KML emissions inventory.  The third parties’ assurance and verification statements are included in Appendix E – Third Party Assurance and Verification Statements. Even including its discontinued operations, KML’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions represent approximately 0.1% of Canada’s 2017 oil and gas sector emissions of approximately 195 million metric tons of CO2e.2 3.3 Strategy to Manage Gross Global Scope 1 and 2 Emissions (SASB Midstream EM-MD-110a.2, SASB Exploration & Production EM-EP-110a.3, SASB Refining & Marketing EM-RM-110a.2, CDP C3.1) We operate approximately 70,000 miles of natural gas pipelines that transport approximately 40% of the natural gas consumed domestically.  Accordingly, we have been an important part of the transition from coal-fired to natural gas-fired electricity generation, which has benefited the environment. When burned, natural gas emits virtually no SOx, PM, or mercury, approximately half as much CO2, and one-fifth as much CO and NOx as compared to coal.3,4 These lowered emissions from natural gas-fired plants have contributed to the recent dramatic drop in U.S. CO2 emissions. They have the added benefit of significantly reducing acid rain formation due to the drop in SOx emissions, which is a precursor of sulfuric acid. Partly due to the increased number of cleaner burning natural gas-fired power plants, CO2 emissions from U.S. electricity generation in 2018 were roughly the same as 1988 levels,5 and 26% below 2008 levels,6 while the U.S. population increased 33% from 245 million in 1988 to 327 million in 2018.7,8 Natural gas-fired power plants also provide a reliable source of electricity to back up more intermittent renewable sources such as solar and wind. This interconnected electricity generation network helps to further reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, natural gas-fired power plants are an important component of the continued expansion of renewable energy. A recent EDF report presented its analysis of methods for assessing methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain.9 This report recognized both the long-term climate advantages of using natural gas in electricity generation and the feasibility of achieving significant emission reductions by addressing fugitive emissions. Significant fugitive emission reductions are possible through broader adoption of 2 Government of Canada. “Greenhouse gas emissions.” Government of Canada. 17 Apr. 2019: 7-8. 2019. <https:// www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/documents/pdf/cesindicators/ghg-emissions/2019/national-GHG-emissions-en.pdf>.3 U.S. EIA. “How much carbon dioxide is produced when different fuels are burned?” U.S. EIA. 8 June 2018. 2019. <https:// www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11>.4 U.S. EIA. “Natural Gas Issues and Trends: Table 2.” U.S. EIA. 1998: 58. 5 U.S. EIA. “May 2019 Monthly Energy Review: Table 12.6.” U.S. EIA.

While several energy companies have made recent headlines for publicly pledging to slash methane emissions from their operations, we have been focused on and committed to methane emission reductions in our operations for multiple decades. Our commitment and the actions we have taken are discussed in detail in Section 3.3.1 Methane Reduction Commitment below. We participate in several industry initiatives to implement methane emission reductions.  Below are a few examples of how we actively engage with various trade organizations and regulatory entities to share data, our experience with methane monitoring and management, and best practices for achieving methane emission reductions. 3.3.1 Methane Reduction Commitment We recognize that methane emissions associated with the production, transportation, storage, and distribution of natural gas should be minimized so that those emissions do not diminish the climate advantage of natural gas over other fuels. We support performance-based federal regulations and intend to continue to manage and minimize methane emissions in our operations as we have for 25 years. Since 1993, we have implemented initiatives that have resulted in over 110 billion cubic feet of methane reductions. We continue to apply methane emission reduction strategies and report voluntary methane emission reductions as part of EPA’s Natural Gas STAR and Methane Challenge programs and through the ONE Future Coalition. Through ONE Future and other efforts, we are working with other sectors of the natural gas industry to improve the efficiency of the natural gas value chain, from production to distribution, and to engender a collective commitment to addressing methane emissions. EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Program For over a quarter of a century, we have voluntarily participated in the EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Program to implement initiatives to reduce our methane emissions. Our reductions have contributed to U.S. methane emission reductions from natural gas systems of 14% from 1990 to 2017, while natural gas production has increased 53% over the same period.10,11 These results reflect both the environmental benefit of minimizing and preventing methane emissions, and the economic incentive to keep natural gas in our pipelines and storage facilities. The EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Summary Report for our reported activities from 1993 through 2018 is included in Appendix F – Natural Gas STAR Summary Report. ONE Future - Founding Member ONE Future is a unique coalition of members across the natural gas value chain focused on identifying policy and technical solutions for reducing the methane emissions associated with natural gas: • production, • gathering, • processing, 10 U.S. EPA. “Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 1990-2017.” U.S. EPA. 19 Apr. 2019: 41. 2019. <https:// www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2019-main-text.pdf>. 11 U.S. EIA. “U.S. Dry Natural Gas Production.” U.S. EIA. 2018.

Initial reports indicate that ONE Future members have already surpassed the 1% target.  ONE Future’s first annual report estimates that ONE Future members’ actual methane emissions intensity was just 0.6% in 2017.15 As a founding member of ONE Future, we have taken a leadership role working with the EPA to identify the most effective means of implementing methane emission reductions at natural gas transmission and storage operations. Through ONE Future, we committed to achieving a methane emission intensity target of 0.31% across our natural gas transmission and storage operations by 2025. Our 2018 actual methane emission intensity from our natural gas transmission and storage operations was 0.02%, surpassing our target. EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program In 2016, we became a partner in the EPA Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program.  This program builds upon the Natural Gas STAR Program and provides U.S. oil and gas companies with a flexible way to make specific and transparent commitments to implement methane emission reductions from their operations. We are participating in the Methane Challenge Program under the ONE Future Emission Intensity Commitment Option for our natural gas transmission and storage assets. The ONE Future Emission Intensity Commitment is intended to drive actions to achieve segment-specific methane emission reduction targets established by the ONE Future Coalition.  To meet these targets, we have committed to reduce methane emissions while maintaining pipeline integrity and safety and minimizing customer impacts. 12 “ONE Future Releases Methane Intensity Numbers of 0.552%.” 15 Nov. 2018.

At these facilities, we conduct methane leak surveys using OGI cameras or other EPA-approved technologies. We use EPA-approved methods, such as direct flow measurement, to estimate methane leak rates from compressors and other components. For compressor leaks, we use the direct flow measurements to develop entity-specific emission factors. When replacing or installing new natural gas pneumatic devices at our gathering, transmission, processing, and storage facilities, we use pneumatic devices with low or zero natural gas bleed rates, unless there is a safety or functional need for a high-bleed device. We anticipate evaluating and potentially implementing other methane emission reduction technologies or methane reduction work practices at our natural gas operations on a case-by-case basis. We expect to report to the EPA annually other specific technologies and work practices as we implement them. 3.3.2 Industry and Agency Participation Our employees have undertaken leadership roles in the INGAA GHG Task Force, serving as co-chairs from late 2008 to 2011, and from 2013 through 2019.  As part of that leadership role, we, along with INGAA, participated in the DOE’s Quadrennial Energy Review.  The Quadrennial Energy Review included a joint effort by the natural gas industry, several federal agencies, and other stakeholders to better understand the issues confronting the natural gas transportation sector and to develop mutually beneficial solutions. We collaborate with the EPA and DOE on methane emission reductions.  We work with the EPA to share data and engage in discussions about potential emissions management strategies. This joint effort aims to identify the most effective means of implementing methane emission reductions at natural gas transmission and storage operations. In 2016, our employees contributed to industry technical papers that were presented in joint hearings of the DOE and PHMSA for the Interagency Task Force on Natural Gas Storage Safety.  We also participated in collaborative meetings with various NGOs to improve understanding of natural gas storage facilities, operations, emissions, and safety technologies. Our work is ongoing in numerous federal, state, and industry venues. We have also worked closely with the DOE, academic institutions, environmental groups, and consultants on several independent technology evaluations and scientific studies. As a participant in the IAB for DOE’s ARPA-E Project, we advised ARPA-E and Colorado State University on the development of a methane emission test site. This test site simulated actual natural gas leaks that might occur at production, gathering, and underground pipeline facilities.  This test site project is part of the ARPA-E MONITOR program.  The MONITOR program’s goal is to develop innovative and cost-effective methane leak detection technologies to more precisely and efficiently locate and measure methane emissions associated with natural gas operations and oil production wells with associated gas production. The next generation leak detection technologies should drive enhanced leak detection and repairs to further reduce methane emissions. We are actively engaged in multiple aspects of the project including: • development of the test site, • evaluation of the various leak detection technologies being developed, and • providing guidance to the test site developers on industry expectations and steps for regulatory approval of these technologies. We collaborated with DOE on three additional DOE-funded studies16,17 to develop improved national methane emission estimates and methane emission factors; two studies for natural gas gathering compressor stations and one study for underground natural gas storage wells and fields.  The current methane emission factors used for gathering compressor stations are more than 20 years old and based on a limited dataset. In October 2018 and April 2019, the final reports for the natural gas gathering compressor station studies were issued, which established recommendations for improved and more representative methane emission factors. The study for underground natural gas storage wells and fields was completed in May 2019 and the final report is pending. Our employees participated on the Steering Committee and Technical Review Committee for each study.  We also permitted academic institutions and consultants to perform testing at more than 30 of our natural gas gathering compressor stations. We also collaborated with DOE’s NETL through participation in a methane emissions life cycle analysis. This analysis was performed by NETL and included input from ONE Future members representing each sector of the natural gas industry value chain. The study evaluated specific emission reduction opportunities in each part of the natural gas value chain. The study results indicated that the average life cycle methane emission rate for ONE Future members was below the methane emission rate for the U.S., at 0.67% and 1.6% respectively.18 Results from the study have helped inform ONE Future members and others interested in the impact of ONE Future members’ emission reduction activities on overall methane life cycle emissions. We are one of seven natural gas transmission companies that worked with the EDF to develop a comprehensive GHG emissions inventory for the natural gas transmission and storage sector.  Importantly, this study’s results demonstrate that the natural gas transportation sector’s multi-year efforts to address methane emissions were not fully accounted for in EPA emissions estimates.  In fact, the EPA had been overstating emissions from natural gas transmission and storage facilities.19 Since the release of this EDF study, the EPA has used the results to improve its GHG emission estimates for natural gas transmission 16 Zimmerle, Daniel, et al. “Characterization of Methane Emissions from Gathering Compressor Stations: Final Report.” Energy Institute Colorado State University. 01 Nov. 2018. 2019. <https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/10217/194544/ DATAENEI_CharMethEmiss_DOEFinalRep.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>.  17 DOE NETL. “Integrated Component-Specific Measurements to Develop Emission Factors for Compressors and Gas Gathering Lines.” DOE NETL. 01 Oct. 2018. 2019. <https://www.netl.doe.gov/sites/default/files/2019-01/ FE0029084_FInal.pdf>.18 NETL. “Industry Partnerships and Their Role in Reducing Natural Gas Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emissions.” DOE NETL. 01 May 2018: 1-3. 2019. <https://www.netl.doe.gov/energy-analysis/details?id=2637>. 19 Zimmerle, D.J., et al. “Methane Emissions from the Natural Gas Transmission and Storage System in the United States.” Environ.

The first report evaluated emissions from compressor seals, isolation valves, and blowdown valves based on direct measurements as required by EPA GHGRP.  The second report evaluated other facility leaks, pneumatic controller venting, condensate tank dump valve leakage, and station blowdown emissions. The objective of the project was to evaluate and analyze the dataset, and compare methane emission estimates from these sources to historical data used by EPA in its annual GHG inventory report, which are primarily the emission factors from the U.S. EPA and Gas Research Institute June 1996 Report, Methane Emissions from the Natural Gas Industry.20 The results can be used to provide more current emission factors, estimate the relative contribution of different methane emission sources, and support more efficient methane emission reduction activities for natural gas transmission and storage operations. We have participated in the New York City Mayor’s Office of Resiliency CCATF since 2016.  The CCATF was established in January 2013 to assist with New York City’s Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts.  The CCATF’s objectives are to: • identify critical infrastructure in New York City that could be at risk from the effects of climate change, • facilitate knowledge sharing and develop coordinated adaption strategies to secure these assets, and • develop findings and recommendations. 3.3.3 Reporting and Compliance Regulation Facilities in each of our business segments are subject to GHGRPs with the EPA or ECCC, as applicable, and to federal and state leak detection and repair regulations. We measure, monitor, and quantify GHG emissions to satisfy the requirements of these rules. We have extensive emissions monitoring equipment and measurement programs. We use these tools to conduct leak surveys for both regulatory and voluntary programs. For 2018, we reported emissions to the EPA, ECCC, and 13 state or local agencies. The EPA’s GHGRP requires annual leak detection surveys at subject facilities.  We have conducted the GHGRP leak surveys at our subject facilities and used the data in annual EPA GHGRP reports.  The EPA’s New Source Performance Standards for natural gas processing plants and oil and gas production, transmission, and distribution facilities, and several state specific regulations also require LDAR inspections to identity and fix equipment leaks. For facilities subject to these LDAR inspections, monitoring frequency and methods vary depending on facility type. Surveys may be conducted monthly, quarterly, or annually.  We conduct LDAR inspections and identify leaks using OGI, flame ionization detectors, and other technologies. If we identify a leak during our LDAR surveys, we repair it and then resurvey to confirm that the repair addressed the leak. 20 U.S. EPA. “Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 1990-2017.” U.S. EPA. 11 Apr. 2019: 67. 2019. <https:// www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2019-main-text.pdf>. 3.3.4 Energy Management (CDP C8.2) One of the most impactful ways we reduce our overall emissions is by managing the energy we consume. Our annual budgets may include budget targets based on reduced energy consumption, which results in fewer Scope 2 emissions.  Per our OMS, which is described in greater detail in Section 7.1.1 Management System Overview, we strive for continuous improvement in our operations’ performance through energy efficiency and the implementation of several energy management initiatives.  These initiatives reduce both our energy consumption and Scope 2 indirect GHG emissions.  People We employ energy management personnel who oversee multiple programs and strategies to both minimize energy costs and monetize our reductions in energy usage. Demand Response We optimize our operations to reduce peak demand by participating in curtailment and demand response programs. As a participant in these programs, when possible, we reduce energy usage when requested by local electric grid operators. By analyzing our operations and energy consumption at a detailed level, we are able to quickly and voluntarily reduce the amount of energy we are pulling from local electric grids. Some of the largest demand response, load management, and utility reliability programs we participate in include the Base Interruptible Program in California and the 4 Coincident Peak Program in Texas.  Engineering Design We have reduced energy consumption by optimizing our pipeline and facility design to utilize devices that use less energy while maximizing output.  For example, we use variable frequency drives on many of our pumps to improve pipeline flow control and increase energy efficiency.  Variable frequency drives also allow us to monitor the efficiency of our pumps, control pump speed, and reduce surge to nearby power supplies. DRA One of the methods we use to reduce energy consumption in our Products Pipelines and CO2 business segments is the use of DRA. DRA is a long-chain polymer chemical that disrupts the molecular activity at the fluid boundary layer near the inside pipe wall, thereby reducing friction loss. DRA decreases the amount of energy lost due to turbulence formation and allows us to move more product through our pipelines using less energy. Our deployment of DRA in key locations has reduced the electricity needed to move products within our Products Pipelines and CO2 business segments. This energy savings also reduces the number of pump stations we need to use. The use of DRA has allowed us to shut down pump stations that were no longer needed, and avoid construction of new pump station infrastructure. Our Products Pipelines business segment has seen a significant reduction in energy consumption from the use of DRA. In 2018, the deployment of DRA reduced our energy consumption by approximately 750 GWh.21 This energy savings is roughly equivalent to 530,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided,22 which is comparable to the energy used by 63,000 homes for one year or the carbon sequestered by 624,000 acres of trees.23 Offices and Buildings We continue to seek ways to improve our energy efficiency in the office buildings we own.  Our Houston headquarters building is LEED Gold certified. At many facilities, we have replaced compact florescent light bulbs with light-emitting diode lighting to reduce energy consumption and this initiative is ongoing. Renewable Energy We have programs to make energy efficiency improvements in our operations and explore new low-carbon technologies where it is economically feasible. In some cases, we have found renewable energy optimal for powering our operations. For example, some of the equipment at our facilities is powered through solar panels installed on-site. As these locations are often very remote and far from an existing electric grid, these installations have been successful from both a cost-savings and energy-efficiency perspective. In 2018, EnterSolar completed construction of a 2.6 megawatt ground-mounted solar panel array on land leased from us at our Staten Island Terminal.  EnterSolar’s array consists of 9,000 panels and provides power to commercial and residential properties on Staten Island. At the time of completion, the solar array was the largest in New York City.  We are considering similar arrangements at other locations where we may also be able to take advantage of this renewable resource to power our equipment. 3.4 GHG Offsets, Reductions, and Targets 3.4.1 GHG Offsets (CDP C4.3, CDP C11.2) The GHG emission offsets we purchased, and the average price per metric ton paid for each offset, are provided below. Year Ended December 31 2016 2017 2018 GHG emission offsets purchased Purchased offsets (metric tons CO2e) 118,609 75,923 66,581 $ 0.99 $ 1.75Average price per metric ton CO2e $ 0.85 21 Avoided energy consumption value determined by comparing calendar 2018 actual hourly operational data for each pipeline segment with various theoretical pipeline-modeling techniques to calculate the avoided energy consumption due to the use of DRA. From this, an energy reduction factor was then determined for each key pipeline segment.  This factor was applied to actual 2018 energy consumption to calculate the electricity that we would have consumed had DRA not been deployed.22 Total metric tons of CO2 avoided is calculated using U.S. EPA’s 2018 national marginal emission factor specified in EPA’s Avoided Emissions and Generation Tool.  U.S. EPA. “AVoided Emissions and geneRation Tool (AVERT).”  U.S. EPA. 2019. <https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/avoided-emissions-and-generation-tool-avert>.23 The equivalent number of homes and tree acreage is calculated using EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator. U.S. EPA. “Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.” U.S. EPA. 2019. <https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas.equivalencies-calculator>. 3.4.2 GHG Reductions (GRI 305-5, CDP C4.3) One of the largest sources of methane emissions from the natural gas transmission sector results from pipeline blowdowns. Natural gas transmission pipeline blowdowns can occur between compressor stations during planned maintenance or as the result of an emergency.  We look for opportunities to use maintenance methods that do not require pipeline blowdowns. If maintenance-related blowdowns are required, our procedures minimize blowdown emissions by evaluating and using minimization technologies, where available. Our reduction metrics are provided below. Year Ended December 31 2016 2017 2018 Volume of voluntary methane emission reductions (Mcf)(a)(b)  2,676,969  4,603,489  4,013,727  Estimated value of natural gas saved (millions of U.S. dollars)(c)  $  8  $  14  $  12  Voluntary GHG emission reductions (metric tons CO2e)(d)  1,284,945  2,209,674  1,926,589  (a) Methane content of pipeline quality natural gas is estimated at 95% per Methane Challenge Program Guidance. (b) Projected submittal date for 2017 and 2018 methane reductions to EPA is based on availability of reporting forms from EPA for the Methane Challenge Program.  Schedule is projected to be late 2019. (c) The estimated value of natural gas saved is based on an assumed price of $3.00 per Mcf for the periods presented. EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Summary Report for our reported activities from 1993 through 2018 is included in Appendix F – Natural Gas STAR Summary Report. (d) Emission reductions are emissions mitigated or avoided that would otherwise have been emitted. The reported CO2e is based on a GWP of 25 if the methane were directly emitted to the atmosphere (GHGRP Subpart W, IPCC 2007). Calculation is from 40 CFR Part 98.233, Equation W-36: methane (scf) multiplied by 0.0192 kg/ft3 (methane density) multiplied by 0.001 metrics tons/kg (kg to metric tons conversion) multiplied by 25 metric ton CO2e/metric ton methane (GWP). The methane emission reductions we reported to EPA for 2016 were primarily the result of pipeline drawdowns and gas engine and turbine replacements. Pipeline drawdowns minimize the gas released from blowdowns by reducing line pressure prior to blowing a pipeline down for inspections, testing, or maintenance. For calendar years 2017 and 2018, we included methane reductions from compressor station leak repairs, pipeline drawdowns, gas engine and turbine replacements, electric motor installations, and alternative pipeline maintenance technologies that reduce the need for pipeline blowdowns. 3.4.3 GHG Targets (CDP C4.1) Through ONE Future, we have committed to achieving a methane emission intensity target for our natural gas transmission and storage operations by 2025. Our target is the ONE Future methane emission intensity commitment for the natural gas transmission and storage segment, which is methane emissions per volume of throughput of 0.31%. Our methane emission intensity rates and targets are included below.  Year Ended December 31  2017  2018  Methane emission intensity rate target  0.31%  0.31%  Methane emission intensity rate(a) 0.04% 0.02% (a) The emission intensity rate is calculated by dividing our natural gas transmission and storage total methane emissions by our natural gas transmission and storage throughput. Methane emissions are calculated using 40 CFR 98 Subpart W procedures. In 2017 and 2018, we performed better than our transmission and storage methane emission intensity target of 0.31%. In November 2018, the first ONE Future Methane Emission Intensity Report was released. The results showed a methane intensity rate across member companies of 0.6% for 2017, surpassing the goal of 1.0% by year 2025. We aim to perpetually improve our methane management approach by: • looking for new ways to reduce emissions, • providing training to our operations personnel, and • communicating policies detailing program requirements. Since the inception of the EPA GHGRP, our annual methane leak surveys have included natural gas processing plants and transmission and storage compressor stations subject to the EPA GHGRP.  In 2017, we voluntarily began increasing the number of leak surveys conducted at natural gas transmission and storage compressor stations not subject to the EPA GHGRP.  Our target is to increase the number of leak surveys conducted at these facilities by 20% each year from 2017 to 2021. We committed to these additional leak surveys as part of our implementation plan to meet the ONE Future emission intensity commitment under EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program, which we successfully reached ahead of schedule in 2017. The number of leak surveys conducted at our natural gas transmission and storage compressor stations and our leak survey targets are included below. Year Ended December 31 Targeted number of natural gas transmission and storage compressor stations tosurvey(a) Actual number of natural gas transmission and storage compressor stations 242 279surveyed (a) In 2017 and 2018, targets were calculated by adding an incremental 20% of the transmission and storage facilities that were not required to perform a leak survey under a regulatory program to the 147 facilities required to conduct a leak survey in 2016. In 2017 and 2018, we performed better than our target number of leak surveys at natural gas transmission and storage compressor stations. In addition, we completed leak surveys at 18 of our natural gas processing plants in 2018. We have set a 2019 GHG reduction target of 2 Bcf of methane, which is equivalent to 1.1 million metric tons CO2e or the annual energy usage from approximately 132,000 homes.

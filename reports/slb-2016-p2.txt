Environment Schlumberger technologies enhance oilfield efficiency by enabling our customers to drill faster with better accuracy while lowering environmental impact—reducing unplanned releases of oil and other fluids, optimizing water use in the field, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Environment THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERIn this Section Environmental Performance  14  5%  Technology Advantage  20  CO2e reduction target set by Mission Emission in 2016.  Employee Engagement: Workplace Solutions  30  Learn more about the Schlumberger commitment to the environment: www.slb.com/globalstewardship/environment We are working to improve our greenhouse gas emissions performance and continue to increase our ability to manage emissions through new technologies, better data collection, and more accurate measurement. We report on this progress annually to RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment, Bloomberg, FTSE Russell, and other company filings. Schlumberger engineering, manufacturing, and sustaining teams continued to achieve their annual Lean and Green objectives in 2016 with 25 locations worldwide delivering on 41 projects that increased efficiency and generated substantial financial and environmental savings for the Company. In addition, our Engineering and Manufacturing organization launched a pioneering environmental program, called Mission Emission, intended to achieve a target of 5% reduction in energy consumption at 34 work locations. While not all locations achieved this target, primarily due to the difficult business climate, the program succeeded in reducing our total combined emissions by more than 27,000 tonnes CO2e in 2016 compared with the previous year. eSource Reduces impact of seismic activities on marine life. 99.96% Our industry-leading rate of disclosure for chemical constituents continues to be almost 100%. THIS IS SCHLUMBERGEREnvironmental Performance During the industry downturn, decreases in our activity resulted in lower levels of energy consumption and emissions on an absolute basis. Our successful merger with Cameron resulted in a small yet significant increase in consumption of electricity on an absolute basis, as Cameron manufacturing processes are more energy intensive than many other Schlumberger business units. On the pages that follow, we highlight our 2016 environmental performance in a number of key areas, and point out some of the many ways in which the environmental attributes of Schlumberger technologies are helping our customers reduce their environmental footprint. Environmental Performance THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERClimate Change As a global technology leader, we believe that our ability to address climate change issues with new and innovative technologies and increased operational performance is integral to the energy industry’s global initiative to reduce carbon footprint. Schlumberger technologies are already directly and indirectly helping our customers reduce or avoid emissions, lower water usage, improve chemistry applications, and increase oil and gas production using fewer resources. Our corporate strategy includes the development of advanced technologies for faster drilling, reduced surface and subsurface footprint, and improved reservoir recovery and production, all of which contribute to lowering resource requirements and creating fewer emissions per hydrocarbon unit produced. We align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of reducing environmental impacts and fostering technology innovation, and we continue efforts to advance internal data collection with the intention of addressing climate change through annual improvement in measuring and managing our carbon footprint. Biodiversity To eliminate, minimize, mitigate, and manage significant ecosystem or biodiversity impacts, Schlumberger has developed a risk-based procedure for the creation of ecosystem and biodiversity management plans. These plans protect sensitive wildlife areas, flora and fauna, ecosystems, and conservation areas. They also prevent the introduction of invasive species; establish conditions to facilitate the rehabilitation or restoration of land areas impacted by Schlumberger operations and project activities; detail any local regulations requiring reporting on ecosystem and biodiversity management activities; and are reviewed periodically to ensure continued applicability. Through its Design for HSE program, Schlumberger designs and manages its operations to minimize impact on ecosystems and biodiversity across the life cycle of each facility, activity, product or service. Monitoring ecosystem and biodiversity impact takes place throughout the life cycle of the project or facility. Medium- to high-level risk controls are applied when Schlumberger operations are located in environmentally sensitive areas, have a potential for significant wildlife loss, have the possibility to introduce invasive species, or could impact a large body of land or water. As far as reasonably practical, Schlumberger uses existing infrastructure to avoid or reduce the need for land clearance for construction. Where practical, new Schlumberger infrastructure is not sited in environmentally sensitive areas. The Company strives to minimize environmental disturbance; restrict movement of machinery and equipment during work activities; plan land restoration; and schedule activities that may cause disruption and disturbance to wildlife to avoid sensitive periods of the year. As one example, WesternGeco, a Schlumberger company, joined forces with Teledyne Bolt, the largest manufacturer and supplier of marine seismic data acquisition equipment, to develop eSourceTM . By combining WesternGeco expertise in marine acoustics with the design and manufacturing experience of Teledyne Bolt, the world’s first bandwidth-controlled seismic source was developed specifically to address environmental concerns. By using a sophisticated mechanical filter to limit the high-frequency emissions that are believed to be the most disturbing to marine life, eSource reduces this unwanted source noise while delivering optimal imaging results and maintaining the lower frequencies that are critical to accurate seismic exploration. The design specification for the eSource pulse shape and spectrum was based upon well-established bioacoustical criteria for marine mammal injury. These criteria take account of the measured hearing abilities of different species of marine mammal and on the level of sound that can potentially cause trauma, and the resulting potential trauma zones around the source are significantly reduced in size. As part of the agreement for this joint development, the entire seismic industry and academia will be able to access the technology through purchase of eSource from Teledyne Bolt. Schlumberger is a global technology leader with the ability to address climate change issues via new and innovative technologies and increased operational performance. THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERManaging Environmental Risk Schlumberger uses a flexible, risk-based approach to manage and mitigate the environmental aspects and impacts of its activities, products, and services. The diverse nature of these environmental aspects and impacts requires a flexible approach. Our commitment to environmental protection, as described in our HSE risk policy and the Schlumberger Blue Print in Action–Our Code of Conduct, requires that a minimum standard of environmental performance is established at all of the Company’s facilities, regardless of local regulatory requirements. Our environmental risk management program uses a combination of 14 Fundamental Controls that are implemented in all of our workplaces, and 12 Risk-Based Controls that are implemented to manage the environmental aspects and impacts of a specific business activity. The requirements for Risk-Based Controls are described in business-specific environmental risk assessments for each of our geographical regions and business Segments. Each of our worksites uses this risk assessment to create a documented, site-specific environmental program that describes which controls are applicable to the site and how those controls are implemented. Implementation of the environmental management program is supported by management systems and processes described in our corporate standards and by a number of web-based IT systems designed to collect and manage environmental performance data, regulatory compliance documentation, and procedural documents. Our environmental management program includes a number of processes that provide assurance of internal conformance to our own requirements, and assurance of external compliance to applicable regulatory requirements. These assurance processes are documented and subject to periodic internal review. Performance Data We continue to seek opportunities to reduce our direct consumption of resources, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce the quantity of waste that we generate. In 2016, three major factors influenced our overall environmental performance: changes in the demand for our services; completing our merger with Cameron; and continued improvement to internal data-gathering procedures, database systems, and reporting practices for greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, electricity generation, and waste. Each year we continue to increase the number of sources from which we are able to track data. Loss of Containment Procedures are in place to minimize, respond to, and control the environmental impact of uncontained spills at Company worksites and at some third-party controlled worksites. However, our industry-recognized number of incidents increased from 22 in 2015 to 32 in 2016. In response, we have reviewed our processes and procedures and continue to provide training to minimize unplanned releases of oil and chemicals to the environment. Water Use Water is used at our engineering centers for equipment manufacturing and cleaning. At our field operations facilities it is used for camp and catering purposes. While field activity decreased year-on-year, overall water use increased more than 14% in 2016 to 3.4 million cubic meters. The annual increase in water use was primarily due to the inclusion of Cameron water consumption data. Data for water consumption represents 100% of our facilities. Air Emissions Year-on-year changes to Schlumberger wellsite activities, a reflection of decreased global activity, reduced our overall Scope 1 emissions by more than 18% to 1.14 million tonnes. Completing the Cameron merger in April 2016 shifted our traditional electricity consumption footprint due to adding the Cameron manufacturing business to our portfolio. The result is seen with an overall increase of Scope 2 emission to 0.70 million tonnes, a year-on-year increase of 20.7%. The combined GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) fell by 7.4% to 1.84 million tonnes. Waste Management To manage waste materials more efficiently, Schlumberger is constantly improving processes and materials. We reuse materials when possible, recycle more for our own operations and for our customers, and use our novel technologies to find new recovery methods. We continue to seek opportunities to reduce both our direct consumption of resources and the waste we generate. In 2016, we continued to improve data collecting processes. What started as a North American exercise is being applied at our operations around the globe. The inclusion of Cameron data following the merger resulted in an 8.4% increase in waste generated for a combined total of 488,000 tonnes. Raw Materials As part of an ongoing effort to improve data collection, we have expanded raw material data to include global consumption of proppants, brines, cement, barite, and bentonite. While raw material utilization typically follows changes in wellsite activity, the 45% year-on-year increase is primarily a reflection of expanding our data collection. Performance Data THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERElectricity Use Our electricity usage increased from 930,000 MwH in 2015 to 1,220,000 MwH in 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of data from the Cameron Group. Cameron manufacturing processes include heating, testing, and machining parts and equipment, which is more energy intensive than processes used in other groups within the Company. Renewable Electricity Use In the United Kingdom, for a number of years Schlumberger has been purchasing 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources under the Climate Change Levy (CCL). However, that program was phased out by the government, and in 2016 Schlumberger and many other companies operating in the U.K. no longer qualified for the CCL exemption to purchase renewable electricity. For that reason, our 2016 renewable energy use in the U.K. was zero. CO2e Emitted (Scope 1) (million tonnes) 1.40 1.14 2015 2016 Water Use (million cubic meters) 3.4 3.0 2015 2016 Waste Generated by Year (thousand tonnes) 488 450 2015 2016 CO2e Emitted (Scope 2) (million tonnes) 0.70 0.58 2015 2016 CO2e per $B Revenue per Year (tonnes) 66,160 56,011 2015 2016 CO2e per Employee per Year (tonnes) 20.8 18.4 2015 2016 Hydrocarbon Bulk Fluids Spilled (liters) 87,000 43,000 2015 2016 Electricity Use (thousands of MWh) 1,220 930  2015 2016 Fuel Consumption (by type) Distillate Fuel Oil No. 1 33% Diesel/Gas Oil 67% THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERThe Schlumberger environmental management program has been developed to align with the requirements of our external stakeholders, including our customers and regulatory agencies in the countries where we operate. To support those stakeholders, we have developed our program to include the requirements of two recognized independent environmental management standards— the International Standards Organization ISO14001:2015, and the environmental components of the International Finance Corporation (World Bank Group) Environmental & Social Performance Standards. Furthermore, a third-party organization has completed a review of our program’s alignment to those two standards. In 2016, Schlumberger owned 742 sites and facilities located around the world and 112 of them were certified to the ISO14001 standard. Operational Integrity Operational integrity at Schlumberger is about ensuring that the company is able to deliver safe, efficient, and reliable products and services for our customers. Schlumberger is committed to achieving a tenfold improvement in operational reliability by 2020. In addition, our multiyear transformation program benefitted field operations through increased efficiency, improved reliability, and reduced nonproductive time. Working more efficiently, doing things right the first time, and lowering nonproductive time (NPT) helps our customers reduce emissions. In 2016, we improved our NPT rate by 55% over our baseline year of 2011, which is a significant achievement given industry conditions. Chemical Transparency Schlumberger developed a chemical disclosure process for hydraulic fracturing, called the “systems approach,” in 2010. Five years later the process was adopted by Frac Focus, a United States and Canadian registry for public disclosure of fracturing chemistry, with the goal of improving industry-wide transparency rates. After seven years and nearly 20,000 disclosures by Schlumberger, our industry-leading rate of disclosure for chemical constituents continues to be almost 100%. Lowering Supply Chain Emissions Schlumberger Supply Chain Services works with more than 50,000 third-party suppliers to coordinate supply chain logistics and meet global demand for goods and services. We have the largest supply chain in the oil and gas services industry, and we spend several billion dollars annually on it. In 2016, we continued to reduce our transportation-related greenhouse gases by increasing quality control procedures and choosing suppliers who are closer to field operations. Our global strategy for sourcing and supply chain encourages local engagement and regional industrial development. We hire locally where possible; this practice helps to ensure a receptive atmosphere in foreign markets, and it helps expand our global footprint in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development goals to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, and to promote full and productive employment and decent work for all. 99.96% 0.04% Chemical Constituents Trade Secret Disclosed Chemical Constituents Managing our Environmental Impact in China Schlumberger Production Management (SPM) is managing its environmental impact in a delicate ecosystem in a remote part of northwest China by implementing a customized standard designed to manage social and environmental issues along with risks and impacts. In 2016, the SPM team worked with its supply chain and local authorities to put in place an environmental protection program focused on enhanced management of waste from power generation, zero discharge of wastewater, application of landslide risk management techniques, and reduction of emissions by equipping asset infrastructure with electrical power rather than relying on generators. Adopting this approach enabled us to meet the challenges of an evolving environmental regulatory framework in China, and it is helping us minimize our impacts on the local environment, in particular, a seasonal watershed sensitive to soil erosion. Environmental Performance THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERImproving Our Disclosure In 2016, Schlumberger became the first company to join the IPIECA in its new category of Associate Member, which is open to oilfield service companies and engineering, procurement, and construction contractors. IPIECA is the industry’s principle channel of communication with the United Nations on sustainability programs. IPIECA develops, shares, and promotes good practice and knowledge to help the industry improve its environmental and social performance, and is the only global industry association of its kind for the oil and gas sector. Third-Party Audit Schlumberger continues to quantify environmental data and identify ways to reduce it. In 2016, we engaged PwC once again to audit our methodology for quantifying direct and indirect GHG emissions linked to our operations around the world. As a part of this process, PwC auditors reviewed our processes and procedures and verified selected environmental and health and safety data. Environmental data audited in 2016 includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of greenhouse gases, waste production, water consumption, spills, and energy consumption. Health and safety data includes employee and contractor lost time injuries and illnesses and the associated work hours to determine frequencies and rates. PwC has expressed a limited assurance that our data are in all material respects fairly presented and in accord with Schlumberger guidelines. Evaluating Potential Impacts Schlumberger has developed a stewardship tool that incorporates sustainability into our engineering and operational practices. The web-based application quantifies potential environmental and social impacts associated with activities related to hydraulic fracturing. Our employees and stakeholders can use this resource to evaluate each phase of a project and determine which activities have the greatest potential for environmental impacts. Sensitive Habitat Mapping Project Schlumberger co-piloted a study with a government agency to enable better planning of oil and gas developments on federal lands. The project uses enhancements of the Petrel E&P software platform to overlay surface stakeholder data with oil and gas reservoir information. By incorporating both sets of data, specific areas such as animal habitats, migration pathways, protected lands, and remediation zones are clearly identified which allows the operator to consider well placement and well trajectories with respect to surface habitat considerations. Earthquake Research The Stanford Center for Induced and Triggered Seismicity (SCITS) is an industrial affiliates program that conducts fundamental research on a variety of scientific and operational issues associated with induced and triggered earthquakes. As a member of SCITS, Schlumberger benefits from the unique expertise at Stanford and is able to liaise with other industry members on topics relating to earthquakes that are associated with energy production activities. THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERTechnology Advantage Schlumberger is committed to technology innovation, and this corporate philosophy was reinforced in 2016 despite challenging market conditions. Schlumberger technologies help our customers decrease emissions, save energy, and reduce resources throughout each phase of the oil and gas exploration and production process. A global network of research and engineering (R&E) centers support our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, Production, and Cameron Groups. Advanced technology programs within each of these Groups help our customers enhance oilfield efficiency, lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity, and maximize reserve recovery, all of which contribute to lowering their impact on the environment. Technology Advantage THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERThe Reservoir Life Cycle The life cycle of a reservoir encompasses activities related to exploration, drilling, completions, production and, eventually, abandonment. Schlumberger offers a complete portfolio of technologies that address each phase of this process. Our Reservoir Characterization Group continues to be a driving force behind the development of new technologies that enable our customers to create geological models and simulations that can improve hydrocarbon production and recovery while also helping to reduce emissions caused by exploration activities. The Schlumberger Drilling Group brings together all of the bottomhole assembly components into integrated downhole systems that leverage our knowledge of instrumentation, software, drilling optimization, and automation. Our integrated drilling system redefines traditional workflows, reduces total work hours, and requires fewer resources to drill a well. Faster drilling with less downtime increases well construction efficiency, minimizes risks, reduces the cost per barrel, and decreases emissions at the wellsite. Our Production Group technology portfolio provides a number of environmental advantages by improving well production and overall recovery while also decreasing the wellsite footprint and reducing water and proppant consumption. Using less water and proppant in the production phase reduces the amount of truck traffic to and from the wellsite, with a consequent reduction in noise, dust, fuel consumption and related emissions. Now that Cameron has joined Schlumberger, our well construction portfolio has expanded to include pressure control and topside drilling equipment and support services. The ongoing integration of Schlumberger reservoir and well technology with Cameron Group wellhead, flow control, and surface equipment into total drilling and production systems is set to provide a step change in industry performance. Cameron Group blowout preventers and control systems offer state-of-the art technology to ensure well integrity and prevent unintended releases to the environment. Schlumberger technologies reduce environmental impact through each phase of finding and producing oil and gas reservoirs. THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERMaterial Issues In 2016, Schlumberger identified three environmental issues that continue to be material to our business, based on information obtained from our customers along with an internal review that assessed applicability, degree of impact, and risk. Unintended releases to the environment, our top material risk, encompasses both well integrity and container integrity. We also continue to monitor and optimize water use and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unintended Releases to the Environment A properly constructed well creates barriers crucial to reducing the risk of uncontrolled release of formation fluids. Ensuring well integrity requires a thorough understanding of the short- and long-term conditions that the well might encounter, which enables optimizing well design from the very beginning. Schlumberger has a portfolio of unique cementing technologies and logging tools for ensuring and evaluating well integrity. Zonal isolation is created and maintained in the wellbore through the cementing process. Cement supports and protects well casings and helps prevent fluids in one zone from mixing with fluids in another zone. Cement systems that help establish zonal isolation work in a variety of reservoir conditions and remain in place throughout the life of the well. Schlumberger cementing technologies provide a wide range of solutions to achieve zonal isolation. To prevent unplanned discharges, we also test the integrity of our containers on a regular basis, taking into consideration the particular conditions of each container, including its existing condition, age, service history, original construction specifications, and previous inspection results. Well Integrity We have developed a Well Integrity Barrier Standard containing 10 critical requirements that employees must follow on the job. Development of this standard was a company-wide initiative to raise awareness and impose mandatory rules that define the minimum requirements for training, certification, and knowledge of the barriers we provide. We also identified a risk assessment methodology to ensure that sufficient controls are in place to prevent the failure of any barriers we provide to our customers. Focusing on process safety, the new methodology uses risk evaluation to analyze and demonstrate causal relationships in high-risk scenarios. We developed two corporate risk assessments: one for undesired events, such as the unplanned loss of a Schlumberger-provided barrier, and one for the loss of containment. Container Integrity Regularly scheduled inspections, evaluations, and testing of bulk storage containers by qualified personnel are critical parts of discharge prevention. Our inspection and testing program involves an external visual inspection along with extensive testing and examination to evaluate container integrity. These inspections are site-specific and they meet or exceed industry standards. The Schlumberger Environmental Management Standard establishes a minimum level of protection for all primary containers through the use of secondary containment, spill preparedness and response, and prohibitions of certain activities. This requirement is implemented even when local regulatory requirements set a lower standard. Material Issues Unintended releases to the environment Water use optimization Greenhouse gas emissions Water Use Optimization In many hydrocarbon-bearing formations, water is produced along with oil and gas. We view this produced water as a valuable resource that can be reused in the well construction phase, reducing the need for fresh water sources. As such, we have engineered hydraulic fracturing chemistries that enable the use of alternative water sources—including produced water, brackish groundwater, and seawater—and, in many instances, without the need for treatment. These fracturing chemistries can be delivered via our xWATER* integrated water-flexible fracturing fluid delivery service, and they have enabled the use of up to 100% of the produced water to complete a well. Material Issues THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERHydraulic fracturing accounts for more than 90% of the water used in the development of unconventional reservoirs, such as shales. We help our customers minimize water use associated with hydraulic fracturing by reducing water requirements via engineered solutions. For example, our HiWAY* flow-channel fracturing technique increases fracture conductivity while significantly reducing water and proppant consumption. This means higher production, simpler logistics, and a smaller operational footprint. In the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas, more than 1,000 wells have been stimulated using this technique, reducing water volumes by 32% while also increasing well productivity by 26%. Reducing Emissions Schlumberger provides a broad range of technologies and services that our customers can use to help reduce emissions during the development of oil and gas fields. Lower emissions are achieved by reducing the delivery of resources to the wellsite, such as water and proppant, and drilling wells faster. For example, in 2016 a successful collaboration between Schlumberger and Det norske improved drilling rates in the Ivar Aasen field by 121% compared with rates from 2010. Furthermore, this improved completions rates by 142% in the field compared with rates from 2007. These improvements in drilling and completion rates helped to reduce emissions due to conducting early and extended project engagement alongside the customer. Spill Prevention in Alaska The Schlumberger team located in the snow-covered tundra of northern Alaska has cultivated a strong spill prevention culture and takes pride in working on one of the cleanest oilfields in the world. The sensitive nature of the Alaskan location, with its untouched, pristine natural beauty and many delicate types of flora and fauna, required an unusually rigorous approach to managing unplanned releases to the environment. As a result, over many years the Company has developed stringent spill reporting requirements. Whereas most industrial spills of oil or chemicals are reported in barrels, the threshold for Schlumberger spill reporting in Alaska can be as small as “drops of fluid released.” Our robust environmental culture in Alaska has been evolving since 2002, when our spill rate—calculated as the number of reportable spills per 200,000 man hours worked—was 4.0. Since then, however, that number has been steadily decreasing. In 2016, our spill rate was only 0.70. Contributing to our environmental performance success in Alaska are a number of programs designed to reduce the risk of spills. This includes the following, • Spill Champion Checklist: a checklist integrated into the Wellsite Location Condition Report where an employee is assigned responsibility to frequently verify the position and condition of all hoses, hardline, connections, sumps, tanks, and spill containment • Fluid Transfer Permit: a formal process utilized by M-I SWACO, a Schlumberger company, to ensure that all requirements and procedures are met prior to fluid transfer • Secondary Containment: containment strategically placed beneath all engines, containers, sumps, connections and wellheads to catch any expected or unexpected releases • Training and Awareness: additional training and awareness initiatives associated with spill prevention • Environmental Protection Measures: the input rate of environmental Risk Identification Reports has more than doubled, from 1.55 in 2010 to 3.5 in 2016 THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERTechnologies Pore to Pipeline Schlumberger is the world’s leading provider of technology for reservoir characterization, drilling, production, and processing to the oil and gas industry. The Company supplies the industry’s most comprehensive range of products and services, from exploration through production, and integrated pore to pipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance in a safe and environmentally sound manner. The full range of Schlumberger technologies involved in exploration, production and recovery may be found at www.slb.com. In the section that follows, we document some of the many ways in which Schlumberger helps our customers reduce unplanned releases to the environment, decrease water usage, and lower emissions. Decreases Air Emissions Reduces Transportation Recycle/ Reduces Waste Reduces Footprint/ Land Use Technologies THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERReducing Impact The process of finding and recovering oil and gas involves subsurface exploration, characterizing a reservoir, constructing and completing the wells, and producing the field. The technologies listed on this page have attributes that help reduce the impact of these activities on the environment. These technologies are listed in the approximate order that our customers deploy them in the field. More information on the environmental benefits of these and other Schlumberger technologies can be found on our Global Stewardship website. Biodiversity Decreases Air Emissions Reduces Water Use Recycle/Reduces Waste Reduces Footprint/Land Use Reduces Transportation Cleaner Chemistry More Effi cient (Saves Time) Reduces Risk Improves Well Performance eSource    Blowout Preventers    Petrel Geomechanics & Drilling      OptiDrill     GeoSphere     NeoScope     HydraGlyde     CemFIT Heal    Invizion RT    Infinity       Manara      OpenPath Sequence    xWATER         HiWAY         MAZE Microfludic SARA Analysis      Electric Actuation Technology     THIS IS SCHLUMBERGEReSource Blowout Preventers Petrel OptiDrill eSource is the world’s first bandwidth-controlled seismic source developed specifically to address environmental concerns. Introduced commercially in 2016, eSource is designed to ensure that marine wildlife is subjected to a lower sound exposure in the vicinity of seismic operations. WesternGeco, a Schlumberger company, joined forces with Teledyne Bolt, a leading developer of seismic sources, in developing a technology that would reduce the potential impact of seismic signals on marine life. The key principle behind eSource is the gradual release of air at a predetermined rate as a function of time. Because unnecessary high frequencies are removed from the seismic source, eSource reduces impact on marine life from seismic operations while delivering optimal bandwidth for seismic imaging. In 2016, Schlumberger deployed eSource for the first time on a commercial project in offshore Australia. Blowout preventers (BOPs) are crucial for drilling a well safely and for preventing any unplanned releases to the environment. If the need arises to contain wellbore pressure, ram-type BOPs provide the ability to seal the well. The Cameron Group designs BOPs that maximize reliability and performance but also simplifies maintenance and decreases downtime. In today’s demanding drilling environments, this combination of engineering simplicity, environmental footprint and operational cost savings, and superior reliability helps improve performance and safety. BOPs are critically important to the safety of the crew, the rig, and the wellbore. They are inspected, tested, and refurbished at regular intervals, which is determined by a combination of risk assessment, local practice, the type of well, and legal requirements. The Petrel* E&P software platform helps our customers identify and measure oil and gas in reservoirs. Petrel enables companies to assess potential for drilling risks, reduce nonproductive time, and avoid unexpected problems or increased well costs. With better information, wells can be drilled more efficiently and with fewer emissions. In addition, Schlumberger co-piloted a study with a government agency to enable better planning of oil and gas developments on federal lands. The project uses enhancements of the Petrel E&P software platform to overlay surface stakeholder data with oil and gas reservoir information. By incorporating both sets of data, specific areas such as animal habitats, migration pathways, protected lands, and remediation zones are clearly identified which allows the operator to consider well placement and well trajectories with respect to surface habitat considerations. OptiDrill* real-time drilling intelligence service enables operators to manage downhole conditions, mitigate risk, and increase efficiency. Reducing downhole failures saves costs and reduces emissions. Downhole data is transmitted to the surface, integrated with surface measurements, and displayed on a rigsite drilling dashboard. Experts working remotely simultaneously interpret this data. These experts analyze the real-time data to identify trends, anticipate risks and, in collaboration with the drilling team, provide recommendations for performance improvement. By enabling the rigsite team to identify optimal drilling parameters and improve the rate of penetration, the OptiDrill service reduces emissions and saves time for our customers. Technologies THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERGeoSphere NeoScope HydraGlyde CemFIT Heal GeoSphere* reservoir mapping-while-drilling service uses deep, directional electromagnetic measurements to reveal an enhanced view of reservoir properties. Acquisition and interpretation of surface and downhole measurements is used to guide, or “geosteer,” the drill bit and improve reservoir characterization. Accurate geosteering depends on real-time data from logging- and measurements-while-drilling technologies. GeoSphere service reveals subsurface bedding and fluid contact details more than 100 feet from the wellbore. These measurements also help to refine reservoir boundaries. By enabling operators to drill wells faster with more precision, the GeoSphere service significantly reduces emissions. NeoScope* sourceless formation-evaluation.while-drilling service reduces risk in logging while drilling. NeoScope service eliminates the need for chemical sources, avoids complex abandonment procedures, provides comprehensive petrophysical measurements in real time, and saves rig time and related emissions. In unconventional plays, NeoScope service technology offers a suite of sourceless measurements to evaluate reservoir quality, provides critical data to optimize completion quality, provides sourceless measurements in real time for better well placement, and removes transportation and handling risks. NeoScope won the 2013 Schlumberger Invention Gold Award. HydraGlyde high-performance water-base drilling fluid system provides a cost-effective solution for shale wells in environmentally sensitive land areas. The HydraGlyde system helps operators address the challenges of shale plays, including their economic and environmental constraints, by delivering the performance of oil-base mud without associated HSE impact. The HydraGlyde system is designed to improve drillability in extended laterals. It is easy to deploy, compatible with most additives, and resists contaminants. By eliminating the waste transportation and disposal costs associated with oil-base muds, the HydraGlyde system reduces operating costs and environmental impacts. CemFIT* Heal flexible self-healing cement system helps ensure well integrity from drilling to abandonment, providing a competent annular pressure seal and protecting against hydrocarbon leaks and sustained casing pressure at the wellhead. Unlike conventional cement systems, the CemFIT Heal system expands after setting, improving cement bonding and sealing microannuli that can cause unwanted gas migration. In the event of a hydrocarbon seep due to cement sheath failure, the set cement responds on contact with hydrocarbons and autorepairs the pathways, restoring the hydraulic integrity of the well. The self-healing action is repeatable if well integrity is compromised anytime during the life of the well. THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERInvizion RT Infinity Manara OpenPath Sequence Invizion RT* real-time well integrity service improves cementing operations by enabling operators to monitor, control, and evaluate cement placement in real time. The service combines job design data with acquisition data from rig and cementing equipment to provide a more accurate representation of the job as it is under way. With interpretation and support by a team of experts in multiple disciplines, Invizion RT service ensures flawless service delivery, quality assurance, and quality control during the cement job. It provides a visual representation of the information operators need while delivering greater certainty and reduced risk of errors to help ensure well integrity. Infinity* dissolvable plug-and-perf versatile system enhances efficiency and cost effectiveness of plug-and-perf operations. It relies on degradable fracturing balls and seats instead of plugs to isolate zones during stimulation. The patented aluminum-based material degrades completely and predictably within hours to days, ensuring that production reaches its full potential; no additives are required. No plugs means no mechanical intervention is required to mill them out. Eliminating milling considerably reduces the time between drilling and production. As soon as the fracturing operation finishes, the well is ready to flow back and begin producing. Faster stimulation of wells without intervention operations helps reduce emissions and waste. Manara* production and reservoir management system provides downhole permanent monitoring and in-lateral flow control of multiple zones and compartments in real time—for the first time, even in multilateral wells. The Manara system provides in-situ measurements of pressure, temperature, flow rate, and water cut across the formation face in each zone of each lateral. All sensors are packaged in one compact station, together with an electric flow control valve that has infinitely variable settings controlled from the surface through a single electrical control line. The system decreases surface footprint while enabling customers to reduce the amount of produced water and other fluids, thereby reducing truck traffic and consequent emissions. OpenPath Sequence* diversion stimulation service is the first in the industry to use degradable fibers to suspend multimodal particles—a combination that enables the sequential stimulation of zones and intervals to maximize near-wellbore coverage. Whereas particles alone are not always effective in isolating fractures of various sizes, the addition of fibers bridges the gaps in fractures and creates impermeable temporary plugs that fully dissolve after stimulation operations are completed. OpenPath Sequence service uses the optimal acid identified for a particular reservoir to sequentially stimulate targeted zones and intervals. No specialized equipment is required, streamlining operations and reducing health, safety and environmental risks compared with conventional chemical diversion methods. Technologies THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERxWATER HiWAY Maze Microfluidic SARA Analysis Electric Actuation Technology xWATER* integrated water-flexible fracturing fluid delivery service was developed to reduce freshwater sourcing, transportation, and treatment along with the disposal of produced water in hydraulic fracturing operations. xWATER service enables operators to use water produced from previous hydraulic fracturing jobs or nearby alternative water sources, such as brackish groundwater or seawater, which reduces the need to transport water over long distances. Produced water is collected in onsite storage facilities and transported to nearby fracturing sites, then returned to the central storage facility, eliminating the need for disposal. Optimizing water use minimizes transportation costs and related greenhouse gas emissions. HiWAY* flow-channel hydraulic fracturing technique helps operators increase fracture conductivity and production while using less water and proppant. In a multipart study conducted over four years on Eagle Ford shale wells, the HiWAY technique significantly reduced the amount of water and proppant needed during operations, performed better than conventional wells on average, and generated significant additional revenue. The study compared more than 1,000 Eagle Ford wells with flow-channel fracturing treatments versus conventional treatments and found that wells treated using the HiWAY technique used 37% less proppant and 32% less water volume—equivalent to 2.7 billion pounds of proppant and 2.1 billion gallons of water—when compared with conventional treatments. Maze* microfluidic SARA analysis fully automates the process for testing oil samples for saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA). Maze microfluidic SARA analysis replaces conventional methods that are cumbersome and time consuming, removing operator dependency and subjectivity from the analysis. Turnaround time is also reduced to four hours for Maze analysis compared with three to five days for conventional technology. This first commercial application of microfluidic technology to the oil and gas industry has been accepted by ASTM International Standard D7996 for asphaltene content measurement. By coupling novel microfluidic chip technology and spectroscopy for precise measurements, Maze has the ability to decrease solvent use by 85%. Reducing hazardous solvent use is good for the environment. OneSubsea designed and installed the world's first, and to date, only fully electric subsea production system. This system has been successfully operating in the North Sea since 2008. Electrically actuated systems are subsea control systems utilizing DC power and electric valve actuation as a replacement for conventional electro-hydraulic multiplexed subsea production control systems. By using electric actuation technology there is no need for hydraulic fluids, therefore allowing systems to become less complex, while maintaining commercial feasibility and increased flexibility. Electrically actuated systems also have the advantage of increased safety and environmental cleanliness. Having zero discharge, electrically actuated systems eliminate the discharge of hydraulic fluid to the environment. In addition, safety issues arising from the use of hydraulic pressure are avoided. THIS IS SCHLUMBERGEREmployee Engagement: Workplace Solutions Schlumberger encourages its employees to become involved in a wide range of workplace initiatives and volunteer for community projects that reduce environmental impact and help build local capacity. Schlumberger employees championed multiple strategies to improve internal efficiency through innovative programs such as Mission Emission and Lean and Green. These and other employee-driven programs to reduce energy consumption are helping the Company achieve substantial financial and environmental savings. Mission Emission THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERMission Emission Target: Energy Reduction In 2016, our Engineering & Manufacturing (E&M) organization launched a program called Mission Emission, which sought to achieve a target of 5% reduction in energy consumption (measured as CO2e kg per man hour) at 34 work locations. However, the reduction in business activity in 2016 led to an 18% reduction in man hours within E&M, making the 5% target difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, 14 locations achieved a reduction in CO2e kg per man hour, and nine of them achieved the target by reducing CO2e kg per man hour by 5% or more compared with 2015. Individually, 30 of the 34 participating locations succeeded in reducing their CO2e footprint. At the group level, total combined emissions were reduced by 17%, saving 27,315 tonnes of CO2e over the year. This reduction in energy use also resulted in a corresponding decrease in financial expenditures, saving more than $2.35 million for the E&M organization. In Norway, the WesternGeco Oslo Technology Center (WOTC) was constructed in accordance with Norwegian legislation designed to drive energy efficiency. All equipment and installations at the WOTC facility are centrally registered and monitored to enable live metering and control of heating systems, sprinklers, compressed air, cooling systems, lighting, alarms, temperature control, and gas consumption. As a result, WOTC energy consumption can be measured by room and by piece of equipment, and data can be retrieved at any time for analysis. This capability enabled a targeted energy campaign, and the facility reduced CO2e kg per man hour by more than 40%. Mission Emission Results Target 2015 in tonnes CO2e 162,782 CO2e emitted 2015 in millions $20.98 Financial Expenditures         5% reduc 2016 in tonnes CO2e 135,467 CO2e emitted 2016 in millions $18.62 Financial Expenditures tion Environmental Savings in tonnes CO2e 27,315 CO2e emitted Financial Savings in millions $2.35 Financial Expenditures THIS IS SCHLUMBERGERFacilities The Schlumberger Global Facilities Management and Maintenance Standard defines the responsibilities and activities associated with managing facility activities with a goal of maintaining and improving the environment affected by facility activities and minimizing utility usage. The standard ensures that facility activities are compliant with Schlumberger policies along with relevant local environmental legislation and directives. Waste generated by any facility task must be measured and disposed of in a responsible manner with a licensed waste broker, and materials (particularly chemicals) that reduce or control pollution must be handled and stored responsibly. The standard requires energy-saving products and practices to be used in all aspects of facilities management activities, and a record kept of energy usage. In addition, employees and contractors who carry out facility activities must receive appropriate training, particularly when their work may have an impact on the environment. Wildlife Rescue Brigade A Schlumberger Wildlife Rescue Brigade working in an environmentally sensitive area in Ecuador rescued and relocated 39 different species in 2016, including turtles, snakes, caimans, and birds. A high level of biodiversity at the Consorcio Shushufindi S.A. site and surrounding area means that wildlife may be found at all wellsite locations, facilities, office areas, warehouses, camps, and access roads. Employees or contractors who encounter these wild species are required to notify the Wildlife Rescue Brigade, which is a team comprised of environmental engineers and specialized support from biologists in the area. The Wildlife Rescue Brigade ensures appropriate handling and transfer of species and coordinates logistics with officials of the Ministry of Environment, the Rescue Center in Lake City Agrio, and the Limoncocha Biological Reserve. Gaining Business by Going Green Green technologies are starting to pay off in Ecuador and the Amazon region after Schlumberger became the first company in the oil and gas sector to be granted a Punto Verde certification by Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment. The Punto Verde certification is given to companies that promote environmental practices and clean processes, use environmentally friendly technologies, and provide services that reduce emissions. The Engineering, Maintenance, and Sustaining team in Ecuador compiled energy data generated in the field to define a baseline, then compared various parameters to determine technologies and processes with potential cost savings and emission reductions. The audit process was conducted by a third-party entity approved by the Ministry of Environment in Ecuador, and four of the best practices and technologies identified in the audit were selected for Punto Verde certification by the ministry. In protected areas such as the Amazon jungle, Punto Verde certification enables Schlumberger to use these green technologies in environmentally sensitive areas, differentiating the Company from its competitors and setting a new standard for its customers and stakeholders in Ecuador. Recycling Lithium Metal Batteries Liquid cathode lithium metal batteries are commonly used in the oil and gas industry to power sensors in remote downhole applications. The batteries provide reliable power for a diverse range of equipment in the oilfield, even when exposed to challenging high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, but they need careful handling and dedicated, climate-controlled storage. All applicable Schlumberger locations have a Battery Safety Officer (BSO) responsible for managing them safely, and batteries must be used in accordance with the Schlumberger Battery Manual. At the end of their life, lithium batteries require special treatment. Schlumberger uses a waste contractor in Canada who has a patented process designed to capture and recycle more than 83% by weight of each cell it processes. The process neutralizes 100% of the hazardous components of each battery (including lithium metal and thionyl chloride), leaving only scrap commodities, which are sold, and no hazardous residual products. In 2016, more than 50 tonnes of Schlumberger batteries were received at this waste facility, thereby meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring full and sustainable life cycle management. Lean and Green Reduces Waste In its seventh year, our annual Lean and Green Program continued to generate a wide variety of projects that achieved substantial financial and environmental savings, despite ongoing difficulties in the global economic climate. In 2016, 22 obligated locations and three volunteer locations in the Company’s E&M organization completed 41 projects, saving almost $1.5 million with project costs amounting to over $450,000. Environmental savings included more than 22 million kilowatt hours of electricity, almost 8,000 kiloliters of water, 665 liters of hydrocarbon fuel, 12 tonnes of materials, and 295 tonnes of waste. The Lean and Green Program combines the resources and expertise of employees within the Continuous Improvement (CI) and HSE functions. The program positively engages employees across disciplines and provides a means to showcase innovations, environmental technologies, and best practices for environmental improvement. Each project applies the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC) process, and uses LEAN and Six Sigma techniques to realize environmental improvements. Although an initial investment of resources, time, and money is required, the return on investment for most projects is achieved within one to three years and the majority of initiatives will continue to benefit the environment well into the future. Lean and Green THIS IS SCHLUMBERGER41 Completed Projects Saved almost $1.5 million with project investment amounting to about $450,000.

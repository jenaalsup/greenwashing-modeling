Since 2009, we’ve successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, manufacturing yield, and capacity utilization.In 2020, we completed the full capacity expansion of our second manufacturing facility in Ohio. As of December 31, 2020 we had 6.3 GWDC of total installed Series 6 nameplate production capacity across all our facilities. We produced 6.1 GWDC of solar modules during 2020, which represented a 7% increase from 2019. The increase in our production capacity and throughput, along with the incorporation of resource efficiency measures into new buildings and Series 6 tool designs and processes, helped significantly reduce our GHG emissions-, energy-, and water- intensity in 2020 as a result of our transition from Series 4 to Series 6 manufacturing. In 2020, our absolute GHG emissions, energy and water use decreased due to the greater manufacturing throughput and enhanced energy and water efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as production downtime at our manufacturing facility in Malaysia for retooling.All First Solar manufacturing sites are certified to globally recognized standards: ISO 14001 for Environmental Management, ISO 9001 for Quality Management, and ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety. We foster a culture where environmental, health and safety (EHS) is an integral part of our associates’ work and require our contractors and suppliers to adhere to our standards and commitments. First Solar’s Environmental, Health and Safety Policy is available on our website. The policy is communicated to all associates through internal communication channels, associate meetings and notice boards throughout the facilities.We have received global recognition for our state-of-the art environmental controls, performance and manufacturing excellence. Our facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township have received the Ohio EPA’s Encouraging Environmental Excellence Gold Level Award. In March 2020, First Solar Malaysia received the prestigious State Environmental Excellence Award from the Kedah Department of Environment in recognition of our leadership and continuous efforts to demonstrate full environmental compliance in our manufacturing operations.  First Solar’s Santa Clara office received the Green Business Program certification for efforts to ensure that our business operates in an environmentally friendly manner. First Solar had no environmental non-compliance cases in 2020.First Solar Sustainability Report 202120GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INTENSITY GOAL2008 Baseline246250200150100500Scope 1 + 2 Emissions Intensity

Since 2008, our company-wide carbon intensity decreased by approximately 77% as a result of increased module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, and capacity utilization, decreased emissions intensity of purchased grid electricity, along with energy conservation and low carbon initiatives. In 2020, GHG emissions intensity decreased by 31% and our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions decreased by 25% compared to 2019 primarily due to the greater throughput and enhanced energy efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as production downtime at our facility in Malaysia for retooling.First Solar is committed to driving down our carbon footprint even as we continue to increase our manufacturing capacity and module throughput. After surpassing our 2021 intensity-based target three years early, we have set new science-based targets to reduce our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 20% by 2028 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050, relative to 2020. We also aim to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 93% by 2028, from a 2008 baseline. These targets are in line with science-based climate goals to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (WB2C), and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We aim to achieve this through increased energy efficiency, going 100% renewable across our U.S. operations by 2026, working on enabling the offsite solar market in Malaysia and Vietnam, and purchasing bundled RECs and offsets as a last resort. In 2020, we joined RE100 and committed to powering our global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2028. We have installed onsite PV installations at our production sites in Ohio and Malaysia and at our recycling facility in Frankfurt Oder, Germany. We are now investigating opportunities to procure offsite solar electricity as part of our renewable energy strategy.22MANUFACTURING ENERGY INTENSITY 0.400.300.200.100.00kWh per Watt2009 Baseline0.340.250.2252028 Target74% Reduction 0.090.160.132017201820192020In 2020, our manufacturing energy intensity (energy consumption per watt produced) decreased by approximately 19% compared to 2019 primarily due to the greater throughput and enhanced energy efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process. In 2021, we set a target to improve global energy efficiency per watt produced by 74% by 2028, from a 2009 baseline (or by 30% relative to 2020).First Solar’s manufacturing energy intensity includes all processes, from the beginning of our manufacturing process to finished module. Increased manufacturing throughput combined with module efficiency improvements and energy conservation initiatives have enabled us to cut our manufacturing energy intensity per watt by more than 60% since 2009. MANUFACTURING WATER INTENSITY2009 Baseline1.92.001.601.200.800.400.00Liters per Watt1.251.232028 Target71% Reduction 0.550.680.602017201820192020Since 2009, First Solar’s manufacturing water intensity (water consumption per watt produced) decreased by 68% due to significant improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, and the implementation of water conservation and recycling projects in our manufacturing and recycling operations. In 2020, First Solar’s manufacturing water intensity decreased by approximately 12% due to the increased throughput and efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as water recycling initiatives. In total, we saved more than 290 million liters of water in 2020, equivalent to approximately 8% of our absolute water use. While our production increased by 7% in 2020, our absolute water withdrawals decreased by approximately 5% due to the enhanced throughput and water efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as water recycling initiatives. We continue to review water consumption patterns down to the unit-operation level in our manufacturing process and are challenging our process engineers to deliver additional water savings. We have set a target to achieve a 71% reduction in water usage per watt produced by 2028, from a 2009 baseline. Since 2018, all routinely operated First Solar recycling facilities in the U.S., Germany, Malaysia and Vietnam generate zero wastewater discharge under normal operations. Instead, the wastewater is recycled and converted into freshwater, which can then be reused in the recycling process. We monitor and measure 100% of the water discharges from our manufacturing, recycling, and research and development facilities. In 2020, approximately 37% (or 1,353 megaliters) of First Solar’s total water withdrawn from water utilities (3,655 megaliters) was discharged as wastewater from our industrial wastewater treatment systems. Approximately 76% of our wastewater was sent to a third-party (municipal wastewater facility) and approximately 24% was discharged directly to fresh surface water (river). First Solar treats wastewater at our manufacturing and recycling facilities using a batch discharge system. Once treated, the water is collected in holding tanks, which are sampled and tested to confirm compliance with regulatory limits before being discharged. No industrial wastewater leaves our site unless we have tested and approved it for discharge, even if it is being discharged to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. If the water contaminant levels are above the permitted discharge limit, it is sent for re-treatment internally. Environmental Metrics and TargetsMANUFACTURING WASTE INTENSITY4035302520151050Grams per Watt2009 Baseline35.19.78.67.37.42017201820192020First Solar’s manufacturing waste generation intensity (grams per watt produced) has decreased by nearly 80% since 2009 as a result of increased module and manufacturing efficiency combined with recycling and waste minimization projects. In 2020, our manufacturing waste intensity increased slightly by 1% due to production downtime for retooling at our facility in Malaysia. WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSALRecycled HazardousRecycled Non-HazardousDisposed HazardousDisposed Non-Hazardous45,0764530150Metric Tons41,50612%7%17%3%17%5%23,29322,0627%78%21%8%5%10%4%61%65%80%2018201720202019This graph depicts First Solar’s absolute manufacturing waste produced in metric tons with a percentage breakdown by type and destination. Absolute waste generation increased in 2020 by approximately 8% primarily due to the increase in production.First Solar is committed to reducing and recycling hazardous waste in line with our environmental management system objectives of minimizing waste and preventing pollution. Since 2012, we have reduced our hazardous waste generation per watt produced by more than 40%. Hazardous waste is classified according to the definition used by the countries in which we operate, e.g. under the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations in Malaysia, Law No. 55/2014/QH13 on Environmental Protection in Vietnam, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the U.S. MANUFACTURING WASTE RECYCLED VS.

The data includes modules that we recycle onsite; both manufacturing line scrap and modules returned from the field, along with many other manufacturing byproducts that are recycled. The data does not include modules that are being recycled at our recycling facility in Germany. The amount of waste disposed increased in 2018 and 2019 due to the decommissioning of Series 4 manufacturing equipment and the ramp in production. Increasing recycling capacity and moving to 24/7 recycling helped improve the percentage of waste recycled in 2020. Overall, of the total material First Solar sends off-site, more than 80% is sent for beneficial reuse and not to landfill. 2020 RECYCLING AND RECOVERY ACHIEVEMENTThe material recovery rate of First Solar’s state-of-the-art module recycling process remains unchanged. We continue to recover more than 90% of the semiconductor material, more than 90% of other metals, and 90% of the glass from recycled First Solar modules. The glass cullet is reused in new glass products and the unrefined semiconductor material is sent for further processing to be reused in new First Solar modules. In Malaysia, our laminate material is being recycled for reuse in products such as rubber mats, bicycle handles, and shoe soles, thereby further closing the loop on our product’s life cycle. The following table includes data from our recycling facilities in Ohio, Malaysia, Vietnam and Germany.Metric Unit Global Total collected Metric tons 40,199 Total recycled - metals (not including semiconductor materials) % 3.2 Total recycled - semiconductor materials % 0.8 Total recycled - glass % 89 Total recycled - other materials % 2 Total disposed - sent to a thermal with energy recovery facility % 1 Total disposed - sent to a thermal or landfill facility for disposal % 4 Recycling material recovery rate* % >90 Percentage products or components prepared for reuse**  % 0 *Recycling rate is the quotient of Total recycled and Total collected. **Refers to products or components that are used again for the same purpose for which they were conceived without any pre-processing, e.g. refurbishment.

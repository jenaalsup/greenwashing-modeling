At EOG, we are focused on differentiating ourselves as among the most efficient on both counts. Our historical record of significantly reducing our emissions intensity is strong and we are committed to continuing to improve our emissions performance. Earlier this year we took this commitment to the next level when we launched our net-zero ambition. NET ZERO BY 2040 EOG is focused on our 2040 net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions ambition. We are not counting on discovering a single, silver bullet path toward net zero. We expect it will require creativity, innovation, and trial and error to determine the most effective solutions. Our approach is a multifaceted strategy that includes efforts to reduce, capture and offset. An immediate and direct path is to reduce emissions intensity from our operations. Our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achiev.able and scalable results. We have made excellent progress through innovative applications of existing and new technologies. We have also lever.aged our extensive big-data platform to automate and redesign processes to sustainably improve efficiencies. As a result, since 2017, we have reduced our GHG intensity rate 20 per.cent, our methane emissions percent.age 80 percent, and our flaring intensity rate more than 50 percent. We value the significance of near-term targets to provide more immediate results on our roadmap toward net zero. To focus our future emissions reduction efforts and establish mark.ers to measure our progress, we set 2025 intensity rate targets for GHG and methane last year. Alongside our net-zero ambition, we set an addition.al near-term target earlier this year to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. Operational performance in the first half of 2021 indicates promise for fur.ther improvements to our emissions performance, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 tar.gets. In addition, executive compensa.tion is tied to year-over-year progress through a separately weighted ESG performance goal under the Annual Bonus Plan. Beyond directly reducing our opera.tional emissions, we are evaluating technology to capture carbon emis.sions from our operations. We are optimistic we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capture and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, facility design, and field operations. We are launching a CCS project this year to capture and store a concen.trated source of EOG’s direct CO2 emissions for long-term storage. This project is a first of its kind for EOG and we are excited to apply our culture of innovation and technology to address this emerging field. Longer term, we will evaluate other options to offset our remaining emissions. ESG IN-FOCUS HIGHLIGHTS There is a common theme that permeates our ESG In-Focus articles every year, which is no accident. Most often these vignettes feature in-field technology innovations that are driving significant and sustainable improve.ments in our ESG performance. More and more, our in-field innovations are supported by leveraging EOG’s proprietary information technology and unique big-data capabilities. This year you will read about a number of these collaborative “in-field technology + information technology” partnerships: • In Automating LDAR, we highlight stationary and mobile system appli.cations that collect real-time data remotely and in the field for more accurate and timely reporting and faster leak detection and repair. • Significantly Increasing Reuse in the Powder River Basin describes how we were able to source nearly all the water for our Powder River Basin operations during 2020 from reuse using TridentSM – EOG’s proprietary water management tool – to provide sourcing, scenario planning and cost analysis tools. • Automating Spill Prevention and Management details the capability of EOG’s proprietary iDetectSM application, built in-house, to detect and prevent oil and water leaks in real-time through sensors, send automatic alarms to field personnel, provide remote intervention and shut-down capability, and analyze trends to improve future infrastruc.ture design. EOG’s proprietary information tech.nology and big-data capabilities are a unique and valuable competitive advantage. In the Governance section, Information Technology and Cybersecu.rity discusses our efforts to evolve and modify our business continuity plans as well as our cyber threat detection and mitigation systems. PLEASED BUT NOT SATISFIED EOG’s culture is one of continuous improvement. Year after year our goal is to improve on all the fundamentals – better wells for lower costs and with lower emissions. We know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost, we have to do it with a responsible envi.ronmental footprint. EOG is focused on being among the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emissions producers, playing a sig.nificant role in the long-term future of energy. Sincerely, Ezra Y.

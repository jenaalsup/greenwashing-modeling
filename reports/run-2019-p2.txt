systems of 1,987 megawatts are estimated to offset more than 
52 million metric tons of CO2e emissions over 30 years.For each metric ton of CO2e that Sunrun emitted in 2019, the solar energy systems that Sunrun deployed in 2019 are expected to prevent more than
 33 metric tons of CO2e emissions 
over 30 years.For each metric ton of CO2e
 emitted by Sunrun in 2019, our entire fleet of solar energy systems has already prevented more than 
16 metric tons of CO2e emissions from entering the atmosphere.132019 IMPACT REPORT  |  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTPreserving Clean Air and WaterSolar energy prevents emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, methane, and ozone that result from the combustion of fossil fuels. The electricity produced by systems that Sunrun deployed in 2019 will meaningfully reduce these harmful pollutants by lowering households’ consumption of fossil-fuel electricity. In addition, 
solar and other renewable sources of electricity emit fewer GHG emissions per kilowatt-hour during their lifecycles than fossil fuels.2,3In addition to preventing the release of air pollutants, Sunrun solar and battery systems do not consume large amounts of freshwater like fossil-fuel power plants. Cooling traditional power plants requires the withdrawal of more freshwater reserves than any other activity. Solar energy production helps lessen this freshwater consumption by reducing the use of energy from thermoelectric sources.

Message froM the Ceo In 2013 our company made remarkable progress in our plan to transform Hess into a pure play exploration and production (E&P) company with a balanced portfolio of higher growth, lower risk assets. While our transformation has resulted in significant changes across our company, we are unwavering in our commitment to being a trusted energy partner that helps meet the world’s growing energy needs in a safe, environmentally responsible, socially sensitive and profitable way. We believe that proactive stakeholder engagement and sustainable business practices enhance performance and are essential to ensuring our license to operate. Our long term vision for the future is based on the Hess Values of Integrity, People, Performance, Value Creation, Social Responsibility and Independent Spirit. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics operationalizes our Values and guides the way we do business as we develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders, including communities, employees, customers, business partners and shareholders. The safety of our employees and contractors is an integral part of our company culture and a foremost priority. In 2013 we saw noteworthy improvements in safety performance across the company. Compared with 2012, the combined employee and contractor Total Recordable Incident Rate was down 14 percent and the Lost Time Incident Rate decreased by 26 percent. We made progress in enhancing our fitness for work, industrial hygiene and medical surveillance programs to ensure that employees are capable of safely doing their jobs and protected from potential exposure. We continued to undertake appropriate reviews to improve contractor transparency and ensure their safety and health systems and programs align with ours. Process safety remains a focal point as we advance our workforce’s knowledge and understanding through training objectives. In 2013 we introduced new process safety key metrics to help us continually improve our performance in  this area. Corporate social responsibility is a way of doing business for Hess and enhances our ability to be an effective, profitable and trusted energy partner. In 2013 we continued our participation in key international voluntary initiatives including the United Nations Global Compact, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, all of which help to inform and guide our approach to transparency, human rights and the environment. We made progress in integrating social considerations into our business decisions using a three-pronged approach: stakeholder engagement, social risk and impact management and community benefits. Our social responsibility programs continue to evolve to incorporate a broader understanding of what it means to invest in a community, build local capacity and promote workforce development while minimizing the social and environmental impacts from operations. In 2013 we made approximately $37 million in strategic social investments designed to create shared value that improves the quality of life in local communities and supports our business growth. More than $19 million went to education projects, including Succeed 2020 in North Dakota, which is preparing students for higher education and careers, and the Hess Scholars program in Ghana, now in its second year. Another $10 million was earmarked for economic development, health and capacity building. The balance is directed primarily to in-kind contributions, support for arts and culture and disaster relief. With world energy demand continuing to rise, all forms of energy will be needed, with fossil fuels continuing to make up the majority of supply for the foreseeable future. As an energy producer, Hess and others in our industry play a critical role in economic development. We have spoken openly about the need for the United States and world leaders to work with industry to develop comprehensive energy and climate policies that will provide energy the world needs for economic growth while promoting energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Hess monitors, measures and takes steps to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The end of 2013 marked the completion of our five-year climate change target cycle. While we did not achieve all of our targets, we made significant progress toward our goals. Between 2009 and 2013, we reduced our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by over 4 million tonnes on an equity basis from our 2008 baseline through a combination of improved operating practices and discontinued operations. We also integrated carbon pricing and energy efficiency considerations in our value assurance process for major new investments. Now that our transformation to a pure play E&P company is essentially complete, we plan to update our climate change strategy with a continued focus on opportunities to reduce our carbon footprint. We are unwavering in our commitment to being a trusted energy partner that helps meet the world’s growing energy needs in a safe, environmentally responsible, socially sensitive and profitable way. In the United States, oil and gas from shale is an increasingly important source of supply and an engine for economic growth. Hess is one of the largest oil producers in the Bakken play in North Dakota and is pursuing development in the Utica wet gas play in Ohio. We are committed to responsible shale energy development and to providing the public with information on our programs and performance both in our annual corporate sustainability reports and on our website at hess.com. We have ongoing efforts to invest in building the necessary infrastructure to minimize gas flaring, assess alternatives to freshwater use for hydraulic fracturing and well maintenance applications, and reduce the use of chemical additives in frac fluid as well as encouraging suppliers to develop more environmentally friendly alternatives. We require our hydraulic fracturing contractors to provide non-proprietary individual well data for fracture stimulation water and chemical use, which is publicly available on the FracFocus website. Through our membership and sponsorship of the Environmentally Friendly Drilling (EFD) program, a partnership among multiple oil and gas companies and several environmental groups, we are identifying opportunities to promote best practices and improvements in environmental performance.  Ultimately, our success relies on a company culture and high-quality workforce that innovates, leads and learns. In 2013 we focused on completing a thoughtful, thorough staffing process at all levels of our organization and providing resources for employees in transition. We will continue our initiatives in talent management, diversity and inclusion, and learning and development in 2014 and 2015. Looking ahead, we will stay focused on creating a work environment that fosters innovation, professional growth and teamwork so we can achieve our goals. Our 2013 Corporate Sustainability Report summarizes our strategic vision and our short term and long term sustainability goals, our challenges and opportunities, and our performance results. We are proud of the progress we made this year and committed to building a sustainable enterprise that will make a positive difference for our stakeholders and the world around us. The ongoing support of our communities, employees, customers, business partners and investors is key to our success, and we thank them for their partnership. Chief Executive Officer about hess During 2013 Hess made significant progress transforming into a more focused, higher growth exploration and production (E&P) company. This transition has strengthened our financial flexibility to fund growth and increase current returns to shareholders. Looking ahead, the company will benefit from continued execution around our focused and balanced portfolio of lower risk, higher growth assets. 2013 highlights • Averaged 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) net production from the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota, a year-over-year increase of 20 percent • Expanded our Tioga, North Dakota, gas plant to process up to 250 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (completed early 2014) • Achieved production from the first phase of the North Malay Basin Integrated Gas Development Project in October 2013 • Completed the exploration drilling phase on the deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points block, offshore Ghana,  which resulted in seven successful exploration wells eConoMiC Contributions In 2013 our direct economic contributions included payments to suppliers, capital and exploration expenditures, wages and benefits, taxes and royalties, interest, dividends and social investments. $ Millions Recordable Supplier Spend (E&P) $7,956 Capital and Exploration Expenditures $6,315  Wages and Benefits (U.S.)                        $1,037 Royalties and Other Payments $807  Income Tax Expense                                  $525 Interest Expense $406 Dividends $235 Social Investments $37 Carbon and NO Taxes $9 x 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% A portion of capital and exploration expenditures may include payments to suppliers. Exploration The major exploration locations are Ghana and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Appraisal activities have commenced in the Utica in Ohio. Developments Developments are underway at several assets, including at Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as staged developments at the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand and Valhall in Norway. Production Production operations are ongoing globally. Key production assets include the Bakken in North Dakota, Okume and Ceiba in Equatorial Guinea, South Arne in Denmark, Valhall in Norway and the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area. 336,000 BOEPD Total Net Hydrocarbons Produced 118% Replaced Production 11.5 Years Reserve Life 1,437 Million BOE Proved Reserves progress and goals Our ongoing challenge lies in meeting society’s growing need for energy in a way that is environmentally responsible, socially sensitive, safe and profitable. We recognize that non-technical risks associated with communities, stakeholder expectations, public perception and existing and emerging regulatory requirements can significantly impact project outcomes and business success. Our success as a company depends upon managing these non-technical risks in a fully integrated way and addressing them with the same care we take with technical project risk and financial risk. During 2013 we took steps to improve how we understand and manage risk in our day-to-day operations. We honed our enterprise risk management process and used this process to conduct a full risk assessment of our North Dakota operations. The result was a full non-technical risk profile, with risks that were then prioritized and mitigated. Our goal is to have assessments completed and integrated risk registers initiated for all assets in the Hess portfolio by year end 2014. Stakeholder engagement is critical to this process of understanding and integrating all aspects of enterprise risk. We seek to establish mutual respect and dialogue with a variety of external groups who have an interest in Hess’ operations, including neighboring communities, supply chain providers, governmental agencies and non.governmental organizations, among others. These interactions inform our response to the broad and evolving range of sustainability issues. Hess’ development of shale oil and gas resources has resulted in both challenges and opportunities. The technological advances that have made shale development economically feasible in the United States have also led to rapid development in parts of the country where community resources are struggling to keep up with the influx of workers and increased oilfield activity. We are working  to sharpen our focus on strategic community investments that provide  long term benefits. Our support of educational and other community projects at our shale energy assets as well as conventional assets around the world is aimed at easing the strain on local resources, building capacity and strengthening communities. In addition to the social and community challenges of shale resource development, there are numerous challenges related to the environment. We continue to make progress in minimizing these risks. We have set a target to reduce our flaring rate at the wellhead to 10 percent in North Dakota by 2017, and we have ongoing initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of our shale energy operations. One of our top priorities is to continue to protect the health and safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate. We have a new contractor prequalification and selection process  that includes enhanced environment, health and safety reviews for certain companies, and recently we established a cross-functional Rail Transport Working Team to address issues related to crude.by-rail transport. As we continue to execute our business strategy as a pure play exploration and production (E&P) company, the people of Hess remain our most valuable resource. Hess offers leadership development programs and early career programs to develop a skilled workforce that will continue to meet the needs of our company following our transformation. For employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of our shift to a pure play E&P company, we have provided several resources to ease their transition, including enhanced severance packages and financial and career counseling. While our changing company has presented challenges with respect to our workforce, we also view this transformation as an opportunity for employees to make a difference as part of a more focused, higher growth company. approaCh to reporting This report provides information on our sustainability policies, programs and performance in 2013. Financial and governance information, including our annual report, our U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K filing and our proxy statement, is available on our website. All financial data are reported in U.S. dollars. Additional sustainability and investor information is available at hess.com/sustainability and hess.com/investors. reporting standards We report our sustainability performance on an annual basis in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1/Oil & Gas Sector Supplement guidelines at an A+ application level. Our report is also based on the Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting developed by IPIECA, the American Petroleum Institute and the International Oil and Gas Producers Association, as well as on the 10 principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. A GRI Content Index, cross-referenced with IPIECA indicators and the UN Global Compact principles, is provided at the end of this report. MaterialitY This sustainability report describes the company’s strategy and performance regarding significant economic, environmental and social issues. These issues have the potential to impact both Hess and our key stakeholders, with whom we engage throughout the year as part of normal business practice. Key stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers and consumers, communities, shareholders, governmental and non-governmental organizations, industry peers, academics and the media, among others. These key stakeholders are essential for maintaining and strengthening our license to operate. Hess conducted a materiality assessment consistent with the GRI G3.1 guidelines to identify topics for inclusion in this year’s report. Over the past several years we have made our assessment process more robust. In 2013 we worked with an external consultant to pilot a methodology to quantify the financial aspects of potential material topics. Collecting source data was a lengthy and resource intensive process. While we report on a broad range of GRI and IPIECA indicators, we consider the  14 topics listed below as our most material, based on the level of internal and external stakeholder interest, relevance to our operations and level of potential risk and impact. These topics are listed in the order in which they are disclosed in this report: Issue Page(s) Ethical business conduct.................. 9–10 Political spending ................................. 10 Supply chain and contractor management ..................10–12 Enterprise risk management ............12–13 Stakeholder engagement.................15–16 Social risk management .................. 17–19 Community benefits........................ 19–21 Personal safety.....................................23 Process safety......................................24 Impacts on employees from corporate transformation ......................30 Climate change and energy strategy and performance .............. 32–41 Flaring ............................................38–40 Water use.............................................43 Shale energy development .............44–46 boundarY setting The scope of this report includes principal facilities and assets operated by Hess Corporation and its subsidiaries and joint ventures through 2013, unless otherwise indicated. Data presented are gross figures from operated facilities and third party activities where Hess has overall responsibility as specified in contractual arrangements. Hess is currently in the final stage of a significant transformation into a pure play exploration and production (E&P) company. Assets that we have divested or plan to divest were part of Hess for most or all of 2013, so we have chosen to include those assets in company totals. Where possible, information has been provided to differentiate data for the future company (pure play E&P) from overall company totals. Data from the St. Lucia terminal are excluded because the asset was sold in 2013, and we were not able to obtain the data. We report some quantitative environment, health and safety data on a normalized basis to facilitate year-on-year comparisons. We report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on an operated basis for Hess operated assets and on a net equity share basis for operated facilities, joint ventures and non-operated facilities in which we hold an interest. GHG data for the joint venture Bayonne Energy Center are excluded from the reporting boundary because 2013 is the first year of operation and this asset is part of the downstream divestiture. We also report our social investments for our operated assets, joint ventures and non-operated facilities in which we hold a significant interest. restateMents and additions This report includes no material restatements of information from our previous reports. internal QualitY assuranCe We have internal documentation and information systems in place to promote consistent and reliable data collection and aggregation from all of our Hess operated and joint venture assets. We conduct quality assurance/quality control reviews and validation to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of facility specific and aggregated data. Due to rounding, individual numbers in the charts, tables and text may not sum to the total amounts shown. eXternal assuranCe ERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS) conducts annual third party assurance of our sustainability data management systems to ensure the consistent and objective data collection and reporting of our sustainability performance. ERM CVS also reviews our self-declared GRI G3.1 Application Level. The Independent Assurance Statement is provided on page 58 of this report. ERM CVS essentially conducts two separate assurance engagements on our behalf. These include an assurance engagement that covers the environmental and social quantitative data and qualitative representations in our sustainability report and a separate engagement for verification of the greenhouse gas emissions data provided herein and also in our CDP Climate Change response. hoW We operate 2013 KeY developMents Further strengthened our Global Compliance Program Enhanced the contractor selection, contracting and performance management processes Completed a risk assessment and integrated risk register for non technical risks for our North Dakota operations 2014 goals Roll out enhanced enterprise wide environment, health and safety standards on a prioritized basis Implement our updated Conflict of Interest Policy and our new Gifts, Meals, Entertainment, Hospitality and Travel Support Policy Complete risk assessments and begin development of integrated risk registers for all assets in the Hess portfolio We seek to conduct business in a manner that meets the highest standards of corporate citizenship, creates a long lasting, positive impact on the communities where we do business and delivers long term value to our shareholders. Our long term vision and six core Hess Values underpin our business. The Hess Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of Conduct), along with our Social Responsibility Policy, Human Rights Policy and Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy, build on our Values to define our internal expectations for sustainable management and performance. Our management systems provide a framework for ensuring operational excellence. They help us track key performance metrics, maintain regulatory compliance and manage risk. We are currently developing and implementing an enhanced framework of standards, consistent with broadly recognized international standards and guidelines, to formalize enterprise wide expectations and accountabilities and support a systematic approach to environment, health, safety and social risk management. The first set of these enhanced standards will be rolled out in 2014, with the remainder to be launched in 2015. Internal and third party reviews, audits and third party assurance guide our conformance with internal requirements, compliance with legal and other requirements and disclosure of reliable information to the company’s directors and stakeholders. Hess supports international voluntary initiatives that pledge to respect human rights, protect the environment and encourage financial transparency. These are described in more detail in the Community and Social Performance section of this report. We also participate in several sector-specific and multi-stakeholder associations, allowing us to learn best practices from sector peers and engage with our external stakeholders. A list of key associations in which we participate is provided at the end of this report. In keeping with a precautionary approach, we evaluate identified risks and develop and implement mitigation plans as part of our enterprise risk management and new country entry processes. We also use environmental and social screening tools and conduct environmental and social impact assessments for major new projects. More information about these processes is provided in the Enterprise Risk Management Strategy callout later in this section, and in the Community and Social Performance section and the Environment section of this report. ethiCal business ConduCt Our Code of Conduct, updated and distributed worldwide in 2012, describes the business conduct and behaviors that Hess expects of its employees, officers, directors and contractors. We expect that our suppliers, contractors, agents and other business partners will follow similar principles when working for Hess and our subsidiaries. The Code of Conduct has been translated for each of our countries of operation outside the United States. The company takes disciplinary actions for violations of the Code of Conduct and related policies, including termination of employment or services. See our Code of Conduct online at hess.com/code-of-conduct. Our compliance policies and procedures all stem from the Code of Conduct. The Global Compliance Program establishes, maintains and enforces policies, procedures, processes and initiatives to prevent and detect compliance violations. Its aim is to promote an organizational culture that encourages commitment to ethical conduct and compliance with the law. To continuously improve compliance controls and embrace best practices, our Global Compliance organization focuses on internal investigations, anti-corruption and other enterprise programs. After adding a new Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) position in 2012 we further strengthened our Global Compliance Program in 2013. The CCO reports to our General Counsel and informs the Audit Committee of the Hess Board of Directors on an annual basis. With the assistance of outside counsel, the Global Compliance group launched an anti-corruption diagnostic to both assess the level of compliance risk to which Hess is exposed and to develop process improvements to reduce that risk. By year’s end, a corporate-level risk assessment and two market-level risk assessments were completed, and work had commenced on the development of new policies and compliance training modules to be implemented globally. The Hess Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy, Executive Directive 26 (ED26), aligns with applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. These include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Our Global Compliance organization conducts anti.corruption compliance training in coordination with country management and the Legal department. The frequency of such training is prioritized based on the level of risk in each market. Global Compliance expects to increase engagement in 2014, rolling out a new online training program, as well as targeted training for specific markets and internal organizations to ensure greater knowledge and global compliance. Enhanced tracking and reporting mechanisms for employees will also promote greater access and transparency. In 2014 Hess will also globally implement the revised Gifts, Meals, Entertainment, Hospitality and Travel Support Policy and the Conflict of Interest Policy, to provide employees with further guidance regarding what constitutes ethical business conduct. politiCal spending Hess policies prohibit political contributions using corporate funds. This includes corporate funds to political candidates, political parties, political committees, independent expenditure organizations or other political entities organized and operating under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. In 2013 there were no political contributions made by Hess employees using corporate funds. We annually report and confirm our adherence to our policies on corporate political spending to the public. See our Code of Conduct online at hess.com/code-of-conduct. It is the company’s policy not to coerce political contributions from employees, directly or indirectly reimburse an employee for a political contribution or channel a contribution through an employee to disguise its origin. Employees wishing to engage in the political process may do so as private citizens. In February 2014 the company formed a political action committee (PAC) for eligible employee contributions. All contributions to this PAC will be entirely voluntary, and all contributions made by this PAC will be publically disclosed to the Federal Election Commission. Going forward, Hess will annually identify its PAC contributions in our sustainability report and provide a report to the Board of Directors. Hess belongs to a number of trade associations, primarily to give the company access to the business, technical and industry best practices expertise of these associations. Hess actively engages in various industry and trade groups (organized under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code) in the United States. In 2013, no payments made by Hess to these organizations were used for express political advocacy. A list of memberships and associations that received more than $50,000 from Hess in 2013 can be found on page 59 of this report. We recognize that our positions do not always align with all formal positions of the associations, organizations and collaborative working groups in which we participate. Our funding should not be considered a direct endorsement of the entire range of activities undertaken by these membership organizations. To address concerns related to potential misalignment, we publish our positions on key sustainability issues in this corporate sustainability report. On occasion, Hess also supports other tax-exempt organizations, including those organized under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, to help advance its public policy goals.  In 2013, Hess did not support any such 501(c)(4) organizations that engaged in express political advocacy. supplY Chain Our global reach extends well beyond our individual company operations to our business partners, suppliers and contractors. Maintaining a competitive and secure supply chain is an important part of our strategy to reduce operational risk. We rely on a global network of more than 8,000 suppliers of goods and services. We employ a standardized approach to evaluate suppliers on the basis of total value, including safety, quality, delivery and cost. supplier Qualifications In 2012 we began implementing a centralized system that houses all contract templates and other key materials and manages the contractor procurement process. By year end 2013 the system had been rolled out to all but four countries in which Hess does business; the system will be used globally by end of year 2014. We also use a central, global, electronic sourcing system in a majority of our locations to collect bids and evaluate suppliers. This system allows for the efficient creation of online Requests for Proposals and encourages the consistent use of best practices. In 2013 we launched an updated contractor prequalification and selection process that helps to ensure we are working with the most qualified companies. Where appropriate, this process involves a credit review, an anti-corruption and legal compliance review, and a review of the potential contractors’ EHS programs and performance. Our procurement staff also reviews the potential contractors’ insurance, tax, legal and quality information; in case of discrepancies with our standards, the relevant department within Hess conducts an additional review. EHS reviews are conducted for those contractors that are considered higher risk, due either to the number of manhours they will work at Hess or the nature of that work, such as drilling and completions or offshore work. The EHS review will typically include an on-location audit. As one part of the EHS review, we use recognized industry safety prequalification systems for most major areas of operation, including in the United States and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, we use processes such as supplier questionnaires. supply Chain transparency and Compliance Our suppliers of goods and services must comply with applicable laws and regulations in areas such as EHS, drug and alcohol use, conflicts of interest and anti-corruption laws, and must maintain any licensing or permitting requirements with respect to their activities. Contractors are also required  to abide by our Code of Conduct. Standard contract clauses include requirements with respect to ethical business practices, human rights, social responsibility, business integrity, search and seizure and quality. In addition, clauses that cover federal contractor requirements are included for suppliers supporting our U.S. operations. Contracts typically also include a requirement that suppliers and contractors allow access to all offices and facilities and cooperate fully with all audits and inspections. security services Our Code of Conduct prohibits the use of military or police personnel services except where required by local authorities or in cases of emergency. We contract for security services from private contractors in those areas where such services are required. Our operations contract for these services locally with support from our Global Security and Global Supply Chain functions. We expect security providers to adhere to applicable international law enforcement principles, humanitarian law and human rights law. Hess contracts include clauses covering security and human rights expectations for our upstream business. The clauses require our security contractors to communicate our human rights, social responsibility and ethical expectations to their employees and subcontractors, as well as demonstrate compliance. The aim is to ensure delivery of a consistent message of performance expectations for security contractors and drive consistency across Hess operations. New human rights related clauses have also been incorporated into some of our recent investment agreements. In the event of a security incident with human rights implications, a report is made to the head of Global Security. Reports are also issued for those occurrences that highlight potential future risk such as peaceful community protests. No reports were made in 2013. In 2013 our Global Supply Chain colleagues reviewed our progress and identified measures for implementation and assurance in this area. We will continue this effort in 2014. For more information, refer to the Community and Social Performance section of this report. local Content In the United States we used more than 900 small, minority and women owned businesses, which accounted for 23 percent of our spend and 25 percent of our vendor count in our U.S. business in 2013. Internationally, we often prioritize local suppliers as part of production sharing contracts or other agreements with host countries. These agreements vary, but may include approved vendors or threshold specifications for local companies or workers. supplier engagement and sustainability Hess continues to engage with suppliers on issues that are important to our industry and our stakeholders. Since 2009 we have worked with current and prospective suppliers of hydraulic fracturing services to define acceptable fracturing fluid systems, including restrictions on the selection and use of certain chemicals. We require suppliers to publish fracturing fluid chemical composition and quantities via the FracFocus website. While the majority of chemicals are identified by unique identification numbers issued by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and are listed on the publicly available CAS Registry, Hess allows its suppliers to use generic names for proprietary ingredients. In 2012 Hess joined the CDP Supply Chain initiative, a third party climate change disclosure program, which provided a platform to collect 2013 greenhouse gas emissions information from key suppliers of products and services. We also engaged directly with those key suppliers who preferred one-on-one discussion. The intent was to improve our understanding of some of our major sources of supply chain greenhouse gas emissions; these are described later in this report. We evaluate, manage and mitigate a broad range of risks we face in our business, including social and environmental risks. Risk management shapes our business and investment decisions and drives operational excellence. Our risk management program is continually evolving to address our changing portfolio and new business challenges. Risk management starts with a common language. Our program is underpinned by a “risk dictionary,” which defines technical and non-technical risk terms, and a risk rating matrix, which includes levels of risk (low, medium, high, very high) based on impact and likelihood of occurrence. For example, a health and safety impact could range from low (a first aid case) to very high (potential fatalities). We begin a risk assessment by bringing together business and asset level subject matter experts to establish a holistic risk profile for a particular asset. Findings from recent environment, health and safety and operational excellence audits also inform the process. Based on these discussions, a “heat map” is generated that identifies each risk and its associated likelihood and potential impact to value, reputation, production, compliance, and/or health and safety. This risk profile is then used to prioritize critical risks – known as an “inverted L” due to their shape on the heat map. Critical risks include high risks – those with higher likelihood and impact – and “tail” risks, which are unlikely but would have a significant impact if they did occur. These inform the prioritization for risks in an integrated risk register, which catalogs actions to manage or mitigate each risk. Embedded risk managers work with the asset teams to direct risk mitigation activities and ownership associated with each scenario. Key risks are aligned to annual business plans. • Alignment through a  • Develop a shared view  • Prioritize critical risks  • Synchronize risk management  common risk language  of risks  • Focused risk management  activities across disciplines  • Align integrated risk  plans, including ownership  • Align risk register with business plans  registers to heat map  Expectations are rising every year for operators to achieve high performance. In 2013 Hess’ North Dakota asset assessed non-technical considerations to generate a full above ground risk profile. In 2014, technical risks were integrated to create a holistic risk assessment. Numerous business functions participated, including Operations, Government Affairs, Legal, Supply Chain, and Environment, Health and Safety. The risk management process was carried out for our North Dakota Drilling Operations and Production Operations and the Tioga Gas Plant. Various risks were identified and then categorized for prioritization in the risk register, including attracting and retaining key personnel, industry-wide flaring goals and pipeline integrity. Weekly meetings and monthly calls facilitated status updates and discussions of challenges and successes. Quarterly presentations to a broader group of experts across the business were used to inform senior management. These meetings also presented an opportunity to reshape the risk profile as circumstances changed at the asset level. For example, the changing regulatory climate warranted heavier emphasis on various environmental risks. Stakeholder engagement was also elevated within the priority category because of increasing activity with Bakken Drilling Operations, North Dakota government agencies and non.governmental organizations. By early 2014 approximately one-third of the risks were adequately mitigated and were subsequently removed from the priority risk register. In addition, nearly all priority risks that remained had a clear mitigation plan with an identified owner. Learnings from the North Dakota risk profile development process are informing future assessments at our other assets. Our goal is to have assessments completed and integrated risk registers initiated for all assets by year end 2014. 2013 KeY developMents Invested $37 million in social programs around the world Held 15 internal corporate social responsibility workshops in our operations worldwide Developed a Security and Human Rights Policy and toolkit; Training is underway 2014 goals Roll out security and human rights tools as part of stakeholder engagement process Complete third party social and environmental baseline study for the Bakken North Dakota operation and surrounding communities Launch Phase 2 of PRODEGE, Hess’ flagship education program, in Equatorial Guinea At Hess, we view corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a way of doing business, enhancing our ability to be an effective, profitable and trusted energy partner. By proactively engaging with the communities where we operate, we can maximize our business value, manage social risks and impacts and create opportunities for stakeholders. We integrate social considerations  into our business decisions using a three-pronged approach: stakeholder engagement, social risk and impact management, and community benefits. Each element informs the others as we work toward continuous improvement. This approach fosters long term relationships, encourages operational success and supports profitable growth. For Hess, CSR is more than philanthropy and what we do with our profits; it is about how we operate. Our programs have evolved over time to incorporate a broader understanding of what it means to invest in a community. Philanthropy is an element for developing communities and maintaining a social license to operate, yet it is not sufficient in and of itself. To make a contribution to sustainable development, companies must excel in areas beyond charitable giving, such as local sourcing, capacity building and workforce development, while also minimizing the social and environmental impacts from operations. staKeholder engageMent Discovering and producing oil and gas have become increasingly challenging for our industry, both technically and in terms of environmental and social considerations. As an international energy company, our access to resources depends on effective engagement with governments, regulators, communities and civil society. As such, it is critical for our company to understand the expectations, priorities and concerns of our stakeholders, including communities, employees, suppliers, customers, industry members, governments and investors. As part of our multi-tiered approach to community work, we collaborate with stakeholder groups to identify opportunities benefiting our host communities, while simultaneously improving our business and strengthening our license to operate. We operate in different global locations with widely varying social, political and economic climates, and we tailor our Building a Strong Foundation for Enhanced Business Performance community and engagement work accordingly. The needs in rural North Dakota, for example, are very different from those in Equatorial Guinea. Hess works to map its operational stakeholders and develop engagement plans at each location. We also require each of our sites to create, maintain and implement a strategic social investment program tailored to that operation and community. As of this writing, we are engaged in a companywide effort to standardize our stakeholder engagement process and tools. We plan to integrate specialized topics such as security and human rights and develop and pilot these tools later in 2014. We recognize that risks associated with our activities can have a significant impact on stakeholder relationships, public perception and the success of a project. To operate effectively as guests in host communities requires a mutual understanding of expectations between Hess and those who live and work nearby. Indeed, stakeholder engagement is a critical aspect of operational success across the entire life cycle of our business, from the earliest phases of seismic study through the decommissioning of an asset. Proactive, continuous two-way stakeholder engagement helps set expectations, averting miscommunication and misunderstanding before they start. One example is managing expectations for local employment. While our operations can create employment opportunities, they are often fewer in number than what communities anticipate. Many of our positions require technical expertise that is not always available locally. Other jobs are short term and needed only in some phases of a project. By explaining the nature of our operations and how it changes over the project life cycle, we can help address community concerns before they escalate. This is also why we emphasize purchasing local goods and services, so that we provide local benefits beyond direct local employment with Hess. Other stakeholder activities in 2013 included working on a pilot grievance mechanism procedure, conducting a social impact assessment in the Shakrok block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, providing cultural awareness training for Kurdistan Region staff to support meetings with local representatives before carrying out seismic surveys, holding training sessions on indigenous stakeholder engagement for employees and contractors in Australia, and working with our trade association and regulators in North Dakota and with regulators and leaseholders in Ohio. grievance Mechanisms Formal grievance mechanisms support stakeholders who are seeking to exercise their rights of free expression and share feedback with companies on their operational impacts. Through our membership in IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues, and in partnership with six of our sector peers, we have been participating in a voluntary pilot project at one of our shale energy asset locations. Hess has endorsed or formally joined a number of international voluntary initiatives that pledge to respect human rights, protect the environment and encourage fi nancial transparency. We have been focused recently on determining where we may have gaps in terms of operationalizing these voluntary principles and initiatives and have been making adjustments if necessary. For example, we have developed companywide training in human rights and have inserted language regarding our expectations for contractors into every supplier contract. In addition, we are active in IPIECA, and in 2013 we served as chair of IPIECA’s Social Responsibility Working Group and co-chair of the Responsible Security Operations Task Force. The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses committed to aligning their operations and strategies with 10 principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights is a multi-stakeholder initiative involving governments, companies and non.governmental organizations that promotes the implementation of a set of principles that guide oil, gas and mining companies on providing security for their operations while respecting human rights. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is an effort to strengthen implementation of the principles to increase transparency of payments and revenues in the extractive sector. The United Nations Declaration on Human Rights was issued by the United Nations in 1948 and represents the first global expression of rights to which all human beings are inherently entitled. The International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work is an expression of commitment by governments and employers’ and workers’ organizations to uphold basic human values. Our existing grievance mechanisms are not standardized; thus our goal with our own pilot is to apply best practice learnings from all the IPIECA pilots to establish a consistent process across our operations that better addresses stakeholder grievances. indigenous Communities In 2012 Hess obtained certain exploration rights in the Canning Basin, which is located more than 1,200 miles north of Perth in the central north of Western Australia. The highly regulated approvals process includes extensive stakeholder engagement and requires exploration agreements be entered into with Traditional Owner Groups prior to issuance of an exploration permit by the state government. We began meeting with the Traditional Owners of the northern area of the Canning Basin in 2012 to inform them of, and seek approval for, our 2014–2016 seismic acquisition program and commencement of Heritage Clearance Surveys. Discussions with the Traditional Owners representing four distinct and autonomous Traditional Owner Groups from the Southern “Kidson” area of the Canning Basin are progressing toward finalization of exploration agreements. To date, we have reached agreements in principle with two Traditional Owner Groups and are progressing the final two negotiations. soCial risK and iMpaCt ManageMent Engaging with stakeholders helps us to proactively identify, mitigate and manage above ground risks that can impact communities and projects. Prior to project startup, new country entry or expanding existing facilities, we examine the social, political and economic environment to identify non-technical risks and mitigation activities and integrate them into our strategic planning. Recent examples include the following: • We conducted an integrated risk review in North Dakota and an environmental and social impact assessment for our Utica Shale project in Ohio. • We carried out 15 internal CSR workshops for global practitioners, to build upon successes from an initial 2012 workshop. • We held discussions with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and government representatives from the United States and Equatorial Guinea (E.G.) to advocate resuming the E.G. revenue transparency initiative. human rights Although it is the responsibility of governments to protect human rights, companies like ours must act with care and respect for the human rights of all citizens wherever we operate. Our strategy is to prevent human rights related incidents by engaging with stakeholders, including communities, to proactively address potential issues. The complex environments in which we operate present an opportunity to make positive and lasting contributions in the areas of governance, transparency, respect for rule of law, and social and economic development. Our Corporate Social Responsibility and Human Rights policies, including a new Security and Human Rights Policy that launched in early 2013, detail our commitments to our employees and communities of operation through every phase of our business activity. These policies also set expectations for Hess aims for all aspects of its activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, including those of its contractors, to be conducted to the highest operating standards in a way that respects our local stakeholders’ culture and environment and advances sustainable development.

This knowledge is fundamental for project success. Our work in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq is a prime example of why this is so important. Hess entered the region in mid 2011 under a three-year licensing agreement to explore two areas – the Shakrok and Dinarta blocks. From a physical standpoint, these regions posed a number of challenges, such as mountainous terrain, inadequate roadways and geographic isolation. But the cultural considerations were equally challenging. This largely tribal region had a long history of conflict with neighboring Iraqi provinces, enduring chemical weapons attacks and forced deportations. In one village near our drilling site in Dinarta nearly every one of the 150 households had suffered the loss of a male family member. Large numbers of residents in both the Shakrok and Dinarta blocks have suffered through forced deportations and are living in exile from their original Iraqi homelands. Moreover, minefields and unexploded ordnance dot the landscape. Before we began our exploration work we conducted a risk assessment to help identify and then mitigate the potential social impacts of our seismic survey and drilling. This in turn allowed us to maximize the benefits to the local stakeholders. We conducted “town hall” style and small group meetings with village elders before we started our operations. We worked with the government to implement a compensation scheme for landowners whose land was disturbed as we crossed it. We also worked hard to hire people locally wherever possible. One thing we heard again and again from our meetings with stakeholders was that they wanted jobs and opportunities. But even more important, they said they wanted Hess to perform our exploration and production work safely and in a way that respects the people of the region. We are improving infrastructure in the region by upgrading roads and bridges that better enable travel across the rugged terrain. We are restoring the environment where we operate and planting trees native to the area. Hess has also provided $500,000 to the International Rescue Committee, which is working with some 60,000 Syrian refugees in the region and their host communities. This funding helped provide shelter, clothing and counseling to refugee families who fled their native country with little more than the clothes on their backs.  employees and contractors. Our Hess Values and our Code of Conduct, which includes specific references to human rights, provide a foundation for our commitments to ethical and responsible business practices. We have been working to more firmly align our business practices with our CSR Policy, Human Rights Policy and Security and Human Rights Policy. For example, before we begin exploration activities in a new country, we analyze human rights issues with the understanding that these are clear business risks that must be assessed. This analysis is integrated into the new country entry process to help inform our strategy and approach. to our business.

We also seek to identify opportunities in the supply chain to provide lasting economic benefit through local job creation. In 2013 our strategic social investments totaled approximately $37 million, with more than $19 million going toward education projects. Another $10 million was earmarked for economic development, health and capacity building. economic development, Capacity and impact Mitigation in north dakota Hess’ legacy of conventional drilling in North Dakota dates back more than 60 years to our first successful well in 1951. During our first five decades in the state our footprint was relatively small, as we produced on average 10,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). We developed a reputation as a responsible operator and a good corporate citizen with deep community roots, in part through our commitment to volunteerism and civic contributions. More recently, we have also focused on capacity building and mitigating social impacts, as our average net shale production in 2013 increased to 67,000 boepd. Shale oil and gas drilling and production from the Bakken formation in western North Dakota began in 2006. Production rapidly increased between 2010 and 2012, moving North Dakota into second place among oil and gas producing states. The rise in drilling and production has been accompanied by significant increases in employment in oil field, construction, transportation and services jobs. The increased economic activity has also led to double-digit population growth in several counties in the region, as well as social and environmental impacts from oil and gas operations. Capacity Development Over the past few years Hess has taken a number of steps to help North Dakota implement education reforms and attract skilled graduates to the workforce. Our largest initiative, Succeed 2020, is a five-year, $25 million program to assist students as they prepare for college, careers and the workplace. The program has been carefully planned and implemented as a partnership with the state of North Dakota and FHI 360, a non-profit human development organization. It supports college and career counseling for students, professional development for teachers, tutoring and online learning. Nominated by the Greater North Dakota Chamber of Commerce, Hess was recognized by North Dakota’s State Superintendent of Public Instruction with the 2014 ACT College and Career Readiness Award for this effort. Hess is also participating in and providing more than $400,000 over two years to a North Dakota Department of Commerce Economic and Workforce Development campaign to encourage skilled workers and their families to relocate to North Dakota for the career opportunities and the quality of life. Local Initiatives One of the unintended consequences of increased oil and gas activity has been the increased pressure on housing availability due to the influx of workers. The additional population has also put pressure on public services and infrastructure such as schools, roads and emergency services. In 2013 we worked with the North Dakota Petroleum Council and with government officials to pass legislation directing $2.5 billion to impacted areas in support of burgeoning business activity and population growth. This funding will expand emergency service capability and upgrade sewage treatment plants, school infrastructure and roadways. Hess is also conducting a third party social and environmental baseline study for its Bakken operations and surrounding communities. The study will evaluate issues from Hess and industry operations along with quality of life impacts to provide valuable information and recommendations. Community development and local benefit opportunities will be an important outcome from the study as well. the blue denmark Campaign Careers in the Oil and Gas Sector We run a successful internal training program on South Arne that allows trainees to gain insights into the various trades on the platform over a two-year period. In addition, we are active participants in both the Oil & Gas Denmark Skills & Competence (S&C) Committee and the Blue Denmark Campaign, a collaboration with the Danish Shipowners’ Association. The S&C Committee is working to define our workforce needs and develop strategies to ensure that these are met. One of the outcomes is that the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) now offers a master’s degree in oil and gas technology. The Blue Denmark Campaign arranges offshore events for students from DTU and the engineering colleges, offering information on the many job opportunities available. houston leap program Project LEAP: Learn. Engage. Advance. Persevere. LEAP is a three-year pilot dropout prevention program for at-risk middle school students at two Houston, Texas, inner-city middle schools. Five program partners, including Hess, work collaboratively to provide support to students who are English language learners and over age for their grade level. Students are identified as being at risk of dropping out before graduating high school, with support provided through individualized and experimental learning opportunities. The Houston Independent School District supports LEAP, its program partners and participating schools. hess/gnpC scholars program Supporting Education In Ghana, Hess sponsors the Hess Scholars Program, an annual scholarship to benefit education and vocational studies, with an emphasis on female students. Launched in September 2012, the program includes 171 students entering senior high school, vocational institutions and nursing colleges. Students are selected through an application process supported by the country’s District Education Department. The scholarships, which are cosponsored by the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), cover the cost of tuition, administrative fees and books. The initiative was created as the result of a baseline needs assessment we conducted with input from stakeholder groups. 2013 KeY developMents Achieved a 26 percent decrease in workforce (employees plus contractors) Lost Time Incident Rate compared to 2012 Achieved a 14 percent decrease in workforce Total Recordable Incident Rate compared to 2012 Continued to integrate a new contractor prequalification and selection process that includes environment, health and safety (EHS) reviews for higher risk companies Convened a cross functional Rail Transport Working Team to focus on crude by rail safety 2014 goals Achieve a 90 percent completion target against plan for number of leadership site visits and workforce safety observations Accomplish a 90 percent closure rate against plan for number of open EHS audit findings and process safety health check observations Meet a workforce Total Recordable Incident Rate target of 0.47 The Hess Rules are seven basic global requirements for safe work practices. They apply to all Hess operated endeavors, and adherence is mandatory. Each rule is accompanied by more detailed and specific requirements, as applicable. Energy Isolation Stored energy sources shall be identified, isolated, tested and communicated to appropriate personnel before work shall proceed. Lifting and Hoisting Use only locally qualified operators and appropriate equipment for all mechanical lifting, hoisting and rigging operations. Working at Heights Personal fall protection equipment must be worn when working 6 feet (1.8 meters) or higher above ground. Confined Space Entry Confined spaces shall not be entered unless authorized by written permit. Hot Work A written work permit is required for all hot work outside of designated safe areas. Excavation and Trenching All excavation and trenching work greater than 4 feet (1.2m) deep requires written approval. Land Transportation Identify all threats associated with motor vehicle activity prior to putting motor vehicle in motion. proCess safetY Process safety focuses on the prevention of events such as fires, explosions and releases of hazardous materials. To manage process safety effectively at Hess, we employ: • Design integrity – ensuring that the risks are as low as reasonably practical in the design and construction of facilities • Technical integrity – inspecting, testing and maintaining our hardware • Operational integrity – ensuring that we work within operational design parameters • Process safety leadership – ensuring that our leaders across the organization effectively manage process safety risks to minimize the likelihood of catastrophic process safety events In 2013 we continued to implement a focused process safety program across Hess. This program addresses three strategic elements: improving process safety leadership; understanding and identifying process safety vulnerabilities; and educating key people across the organization in basic process safety awareness. Most notably, in 2013 we completed an enterprise wide “process safety health check,” a high-level internal assessment of the process safety programs at our key production assets and drilling operations around the world. Through this assessment we identified several opportunities for improvement. In 2014, on-time closure of health check action items will be incorporated into the annual incentive plan formula for Hess employees. Another effort in 2013 involved delivering process safety awareness training to plant personnel and a cross-section of leaders at the middle and senior levels. An additional process safety training module will be developed by the end of 2014 and will build upon the training currently being deployed. The chart on the following page shows our process safety performance in 2013, as measured by Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events, based on industry criteria for Tier 1 (greater consequence) and Tier 2 (lesser consequence) process safety events. We will review all Tier 1 process safety event investigations to further improve the quality and effectiveness of the investigations and to maximize what we learn from these events to improve our overall process safety performance. Select Hess production assets and drilling and completion operations will begin tracking Tier 3 and Tier 4 process safety key performance indicators (KPIs) in 2014, which include such metrics as timely closure of previous health check action items, activation of safety systems and overdue safety critical equipment inspections. eMergenCY preparedness and response Unanticipated, safety related disruptions to our business, whether caused by weather events or process safety incidents, trigger our emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures. Through these procedures, we seek to protect people from injury, the environment from spills and other accidents, our assets from damage and the company’s reputation from harm – in that order. Each Hess region has its own Emergency Response Network that spans three operational levels – asset, regional and enterprise. Each level comprises personnel trained in their roles and responsibilities for incident response and mitigation. In 2013, due to the company transition to a pure play exploration and production (E&P) company, we implemented an in-depth “management of change” process to ensure we maintained appropriate personnel, standards and emergency escalation models throughout the transition. Through this process we identified and then closed several gaps. In August 2013, for instance, due to the closing of Hess’ London office, we shifted responsibility for emergency response support for assets in seven European and African countries from London to Houston. In so doing, we held six training sessions to educate the Houston-based Incident Support Team about their new responsibilities. We routinely conduct emergency exercises and drills, as well as engage local emergency management in these efforts.  In 2014 we will conduct our most complex exercise yet – the simulation of an offshore loss of containment incident similar to  the Macondo event that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. This exercise will involve Hess’ Gulf of Mexico assets, including approximately 60–70 Hess and contractor personnel. We maintain strong relationships with mutual aid and emergency response organizations at the local, regional and global levels to enhance our ability to respond swiftly and effectively to any incident. In 2013 we subscribed to the Subsea Well Intervention Service, a new program that provides well capping and dispersant equipment and oil spill dispersant that can be deployed internationally.

In early 2014 persons at each of our assets were trained in how to use this service. ContraCtor ManageMent At Hess, contractors now comprise  83 percent of the workforce in our E&P business. As the proportion of contractors in our workforce has increased in recent years, we have significantly strengthened our contractor management processes. As part of the procurement process, EHS reviews are conducted for those contractors that are considered higher risk, due either to the number of manhours they will work at Hess or the nature of that work, such as drilling and completions or offshore work. As one part of the EHS review, we use recognized industry safety prequalification software for most major areas of Hess operations. Elsewhere, we use in-house processes such as supplier questionnaires. In the United States, potential contractors receive a grade based on items such as insurance and safety record. If potential contractors receive a low grade, the asset director (or above) must endorse a safety action plan before the contractor may be approved. The procurement process will also typically include an on-location audit. New contractors take part in a four-step onboarding and engagement program. In 2013 we put a particular focus on the safety performance of our existing contractors, ranking all of them from a safety risk perspective and then developing safety action plans for the 20 deemed the highest risk. We then tracked the completion of those safety action plans, and included that as a metric in the bonus formula for Hess employees. health and Wellness Our health and wellness strategy encompasses eight elements of health management: health risk assessment and planning; industrial hygiene and control of workplace exposures; medical emergency management; management of ill health in the workplace; fitness for task assessment and health surveillance; health impact assessment; health reporting and record management; and public health interface and promotion of good health. In 2014 we will conduct an analysis of all of our programs in these eight categories – location by location – to identify any gaps and priorities and develop associated action plans. At many of our locations, we conduct industrial health monitoring to make sure the workforce is not exposed to chemical, physical, ergonomic or biological hazards. We also offer company sponsored mobile health services to employees in many of our U.S. locations; these include full physicals, fitness for duty exams, immunizations and more. For international employee travel or relocation outside the United States, we provide appropriate vaccinations as well as referrals to medical specialists with expertise in issues specific to that location. We also give employees access to a variety of online, telephonic coaching and worksite based health management resources and tools focusing on nutrition and healthy eating, exercise, stress management, tobacco cessation, disease management and mental health.

Our HPI pilot was a success, with 80 percent of participants In North America, the transport of crude oil by rail has increased markedly in recent years due to the rise in shale oil production in the United States. Over the past year, these rail shipments received heightened scrutiny and publicity, as a few train derailment incidents dominated the headlines. In 2011 Hess worked with railroad companies, regulators and industry experts (including manufacturers, lessors and shippers) to design a better railcar, commonly referred to as the AAR Petition P-1577 design. We had the first fleet in the Bakken in North Dakota – and in the industry – made up entirely of this newer type of railcar, which was precisely designed to safely transport crude oil, including light, sweet crude, such as from the Bakken. These railcars are equipped with enhanced features, including thicker and stronger steel, half head shields, top fittings protection and a reclosing pressure relief device. In addition, our cars are equipped with running gear specifically selected for high mileage unit train service. We also operate a state-of-the-art loading terminal in Tioga, North Dakota. In operation since late 2011, this terminal was designed for safe, compliant and efficient operation with heavy duty rail infrastructure and loading facilities. The terminal has enhanced safety features, including a fire suppression system and an environmentally responsible “closed loop” loading system with vapor recovery to minimize fugitive emissions of volatile organic compounds during the loading process. We use a terminal and port specialist company, Watco, to safely operate the Tioga Rail Terminal, load our crude oil and prepare our trains for departure. We also work closely with the railroads, including BNSF, Union Pacific, CSX and Norfolk Southern, to ensure that our oil is delivered safely. In early 2014 we finalized a new light sweet crude safety data sheet (SDS) suitable for Bakken and other light crudes. The SDS, which details the material’s hazards and appropriate emergency response measures, accompanies rail shipments and is used by Hess personnel and contractors working with Bakken crude. We also recently organized and convened an internal Rail Transport Working Team, which now meets weekly. The team includes Hess employees from our North Dakota operations team as well as employees from other functions, including Communications, Government Affairs, Commercial and Marketing, and EHS. The purpose of the team is to better share relevant information regarding any and all issues relating to rail safety. Hess is actively engaged with oil and gas industry efforts to further improve the safety Tioga Rail Terminal, North Dakota of rail crude oil transport. Hess is represented on the American Petroleum Institute (API) Rail Policy Committee, Government Affairs Committee and Rail Transportation Group. We also co-chair the Characterization and Classification of Crude Oil Standard Development Working Group, which is developing a new API Standard. Because improving crude-by-rail safety is a shared effort among regulators, the rail companies and operators, we are also active on several task forces that include all these stakeholders. These include the American Association of Railroad’s Task Force T87.6, which is working on improved tank car design and operations, and the Surface Transportation Board’s Rail Energy Transportation Advisory Committee. We have also engaged directly with rail company executives to discuss opportunities for improving and maintaining rail safety and infrastructure, such that the potential for future derailments can be minimized. 2014 goals Continue programs for employees in transition Progress initiatives in key programs, including talent management, diversity and inclusion, and learning and development

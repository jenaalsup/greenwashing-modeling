REPORT INTRODUCTION CHAIRMAN’S LETTER Chairman’s Letter Con Edison energizes the lives of more than 10 million people across the metropolitan New York area. We have long been recognized by leaders in business, government, and the energy industry for providing customers with safe and reliable energy. Yet we are also in the forefront of change. Changes in technology, policy, and customer expectations are creating extraordinary opportunities for us. We are finding new ways to excel at what we do—eliminate accidents and injuries, protect the environment, improve the performance of our energy systems, and enhance our customer experience. Given the public’s growing desire for renewable and distributed energy resources beyond the traditional forms of electric, gas, and steam, we are preparing for a future that includes newer resources—including solar, wind, combined heat and power, fuel cells, and battery storage. New York City’s largest rooftop solar installation, in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, is one of our projects. We have invested $2.5 billion in large-scale solar and wind projects in 16 states through our Clean Energy Business subsidiary, and we are North America’s fifth-largest solar producer. At the same time, we are increasing customer options for energy savings and expanding our vigorous energy efficiency programs. Since 2005, we have reduced our carbon footprint by 48 percent, which is equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road. We have converted more than 6,500 large buildings from oil to cleaner natural gas—that is in part why New York City has its cleanest air in 50 years. Facing new challenges posed by climate change, we have invested $1 billion to make our energy systems more resilient. These upgrades have prevented more than 225,000 customer outages since 2013. We will also be installing more than 5 million smart meters over the next five years to reduce energy usage, improve electric system performance, and give our customers improved visibility and control of their energy use. Our customers and communities matter. Last year, we made more than $12 million in charitable contributions to local non.profits. Our employees also donated 12,000 hours of their own time volunteering in our communities. Con Edison finished 2016 with the lowest injury rate in our company’s history. Orange & Rockland Utilities had its second-lowest injury rate ever. While those facts are impressive, we won’t claim success until we meet our goal of a zero-harm environment for our employees and the people we serve. We finished 2016 strong, and we’re poised to build on that momentum. Read, watch, and listen to our Sustainability Report to learn more about what we’re doing to better serve our customers and protect the environment. Because more than 10 million people are depending on us for reliable power and a sustainable future. — John McAvoy, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Consolidated Edison, Inc. REPORT INTRODUCTION COMPANY PROFILE Company Profile Consolidated Edison, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest investor-owned energy-delivery companies, with approximately $12 billion in annual revenues and $49 billion in assets.

Our research and development teams work diligently to find solutions that make the workplace safer and improve the quality of life for our customers. Here are some of our ongoing projects: Safety A machine using advanced robotic technology to allow workers to remotely perform key cable splicing operations. It would be the first of its kind for a utility company The use of drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) to inspect steam boilers as high as 150 feet. A special cage protects the drone from making contact with the boiler tubes and burners Two ergonomic devices that reduce the risk of back injuries caused by repetitive motion or heavy work. One device is worn over a worker’s clothes, the other clips onto a worker’s belt Operational Excellence Technologies capable of estimating emissions from non-hazardous leaks in our gas distribution system to give priority to repairing leaks that have the highest natural gas emissions Collaboration with other energy companies and the Department of Homeland Security to review best practices in cybersecurity at electric-steam generating plants A process to better control voltage levels on feeder lines that run from substations to the electric distribution system to increase efficiency, reduce overall energy use, manage energy demand during peak periods, and help facilitate solar and other distributed energy resources Customer Experience Advanced steam-heating control lets occupants in a Long Island City building use a smart wall thermostat to schedule their desired apartment temperature. This will save customers money, give customers control, and increase comfort Testing software that would provide financial incentives to customers who charge their electric vehicles during our system’s off-peak periods Working with the Fire Department of New York on a first-of-its-kind program to test the safety of lithium ion and other battery chemistries before they are installed in large city buildings We began placing methane detectors in homes in 2016. Methane detectors have been effective in alerting residents to natural gas leaks and enhancing public safety. One of our Bronx customers, Pearl Alleyne, says her home methane detector saved her life. REPORT INTRODUCTION AWARDS & RECOGNITION Awards & Recognition As we continue to serve our customers, promote safety, and help preserve the environment, we receive many plaudits and prestigious awards for our projects and operational excellence. Here is a baker’s dozen from our list of honors: JD Power ranks us No. 1 in customer satisfaction among large utilities in the East.

We are also specifically focused on the elimination of severe injuries—we have set a goal of zero high-hazard injuries. CECONY’s 1.17 injury and illness rate in 2017 surpassed our goal of 1.20. We had 137 recordable employee injuries in 2016, and in 2017 we lowered that to 126 recordable employee injuries, our lowest ever. CECONY has reduced injuries by more than 60 percent since 2009; O&R has seen a 50-percent reduction in injuries since 2009. Among the reasons for the improvement: strong, constructive partnerships between management and union leadership on safety formalized job planning, with special emphasis on high-energy jobs, in every organization open communication and inclusion on every job at every level the pursuit of predictive analytics as means to continue improvement of our safety record companywide use of error-avoidance tools O&R saw its third-lowest incidence rate of 1.93 in 2017, though this was above the goal of 1.5. The Company experienced one High Hazard Injury, the first High Hazard Injury since June 2009. O&R continues to implement and engage employees in zero harm strategies. Our company also introduced LiveSafe, a free mobile app that gives employees a direct line to corporate security, quick access to safety maps, contact with emergency responders, and other resources to keep them safe on the job and at home. Con Edison of New York Orange and Rockland

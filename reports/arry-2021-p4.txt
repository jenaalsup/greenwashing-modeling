ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES Promoting sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels has been at the center of Array’s mission since its founding in 1992. Today, we are a global leader in advancing the proliferation and productivity of solar technology, but we’re also conscious of our own operational impact on the planet. MEASURING AND MANAGING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT In 2021, our Albuquerque manufacturing facility began implementing  Array’s Operational Boundary for Environmental Data  an Environmental Management System to meet the ISO 14001:2015  In our 2021 ESG report, the scope of operational environmental  standards. The key projects in this effort includes enhanced data data represents facilities that we own and over which we have  collection for measuring key environmental metrics, including  operational control. In 2021, this includes only our Albuquerque,  company-wide Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions,1 energy/electricity  NM facility. Excluded from this operational boundary are  consumed by our Albuquerque operations, and waste aluminum  a number of leased office facilities where we do not have  recycling. It also includes beginning to integrate environmental  operational control. We believe that these represent a small  standards into our supplier auditing process and product  proportion of our direct environmental footprint. In the future,  development processes.  we will work to expand this operational boundary to include  additional information from leased facilities.  In our second year of environmental management, we are continuing  to track and working to manage our key environmental metrics. With  our new ESG goals in place, we will continue to report our progress  and manage these metrics over time. We will also work to enhance  our environmental data, including a formal Scope 3 inventory and  additional waste metrics.  1 Scope 1:Direct GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by Array.

We are removing this metric from ESG reporting to avoid confusion until we have a chance to quantify our material Scope 3 categories. 3 Location-based energy totals reflect the average emissions intensity of grids from which the company draws energy.

First, we energized previously installed modules at our Midway facility, contributing ~2% renewable energy to our total energy consumption. In addition, our utility provider PNM increased renewable energy use in their electricity services, contributing an additional ~23% renewable energy to our total energy consumption. We will continue to find ways to improve this metric over time, aligned with our ESG goals.WATER MANAGEMENT In 2021, our Albuquerque facility worked to enhance our landscaping with drought-resistant plant species to significantly reduce our total water consumption. WASTE MANAGEMENT 2021 Message from Our Company ESG Strategy Product Environmental ESG REPORT Leadership Sustainability Initiatives

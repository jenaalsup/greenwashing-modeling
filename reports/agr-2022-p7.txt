Financing and 
Investing to HelpCreate a Clean Energy FutureAs a leading sustainable energy company at the forefront of 
the U.S. transition to clean 
energy, investments in our two primary businesses – networks and renewables – serve as the foundation for our growth 
strategy. These investments are central to our efforts to achieve a clean energy future while also creating consistent earnings growth and stable dividend 
payments for our shareholders. At AVANGRID, strong financial stewardship begins with a commitment to our ESG+F strategy, and by adhering to 
this approach we’re creating better service and outcomes 
for our customers today while helping to create a more sustainable future. Our targeted investments demonstrate that we can deliver positive benefits for all our stakeholders, including our customers, communities and shareholders. SUSTAINABILITY DRIVES GROWTHTo advance our financial growth while championing a 
clean energy future, we are committed to strong corporate governance, ethics and integrity, along with our core 
commitments to safety, security and our employees. 
Combined, these commitments are embedded in every action we take and every decision we make. As we make investments to modernize our energy grid, 
and as we invest in more renewable power generation, we’re improving resiliency, safety, reliability and transmission, 
and these improvements help us perform more efficiently. These business activities align with our sustainability 
commitments, including our commitments to help 
address the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and specifically SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Our financial results demonstrate that we are 
on the right path, and in 2022, we reported 
$881 million in net income, an increase of 
25% over 2021.We see green financing (structured financial 
activities created to ensure a better environmental outcome) as a valuable tool to support our 
investment program, to create accountability 
with our investors and to help us adhere to our socially responsible business practices.In 2022, we added $275 million to our existing green 
bond portfolio by issuing an inaugural utility green bond 
at CMP to finance investments in system resiliency, LED 
street lighting and advanced metering infrastructure. 
These issuances increased our total green bond portfolio 
to $2.85 billion as of the publication date of this report. 
In addition, of the $21.5 billion we forecast investing 
between 2023 and 2025, $5.9 billion will be eligible under 
our current Framework for Green Financing, as these 
funds will go toward investments in renewable energy, 
energy efficiency, climate change adaptation and 
clean transportation.Along with being an early adopter of green bonds, 
we are one of the first U.S. companies to execute a 
sustainability-linked credit facility (in 2018), which links 
our pricing in that facility to our carbon emissions intensity. We’re glad to see that since issuing our first green bonds, 
the market has evolved, and today lower-cost financing in these markets is becoming available. This is helping us 
bring our ESG+F strategy to life as we work to create a clean 
energy future while meeting our financial goals.NYSE:AGRINTRODUCTION     |     BUSINESS OVERVIEW     |     CLIMATE CHANGE     |     ENVIRONMENT     |     SOCIAL     |     GOVERNANCE     |     FINANCIALGreen FinancingFramework$2.85 B TOTAL GREEN BOND

The non-GAAP financial measures we use are specific to AVANGRID and the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies may not be calculated in the same manner. We use these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, to establish operating budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. We believe that presenting such non-GAAP financial measures is useful because such measures can be used to analyze and compare 
profitability between companies and industries by eliminating the impact of certain 
non-cash charges. In addition, we present non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors, 
securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance. We define adjusted net income as net income adjusted to exclude mark-to-market 
earnings from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used by AVANGRID to 
economically hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying physical transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity, costs incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, an offshore contract provision, and at PNMR before Merger. We believe 
adjusted net income is more useful in understanding and evaluating actual and projected financial performance and contribution of AVANGRID core lines of business and to more fully compare and explain our results. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to adjusted net income is net income. We also define adjusted earnings per share, or adjusted EPS, as adjusted net income converted to an earnings per share amount. The use of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered 
in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, AVANGRID’s U.S. GAAP financial 
information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness, may be unique to AVANGRID, and should be considered only as a supplement to AVANGRID’s U.S. GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other 
companies and have limitations as analytical tools. Non-GAAP financial measures are not primary measurements of our performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income, net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. We use the following non-GAAP metrics in our presentation, which are reconciled to their closest GAAP financial measure in the 
Appendix: Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Numbers in presentation may not 
add due to rounding. The information presented herein was prepared by AVANGRID solely with respect to AVANGRID’s businesses and financial performance. Investors and others should note that AVANGRID routinely posts important information on its website and considers the Investor Relations section, avangrid.com/wps/portal/avangrid/Investors, a channel of distribution.Non-U.S. GAAP Financial MeasuresRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) – $M (UNAUDITED) 2022 2021 Net Income $881 $707 Adjustments:  Mark-to-market adjustments – Renewables - 53 Offshore contract provision 24 Impact of COVID-19 - 34 Merger costs 4 12 Income tax impact of adjustments* (7) (26) Adjusted Net Income $901 $780 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS) 2022 2021 Earnings Per Share $2.28 $1.97 Adjustments: Mark-to-market adjustments – Renewables - 0.15 Offshore contract provision 0.06 - Impact of COVID-19 - 0.10 Merger costs 0.01 0.03 Income tax impact of adjustments* (0.02) (0.07) Adjusted Earnings Per Share $2.33 $2.18 Weighted Avg # of Shares (M) 386.7 358.1 *   	2022: Income tax impact of adjustments: For the year ended December 31, 2022, $(6) from an offshore contract 	provision and $(1) million from merger costs.*   	2021: Income tax impact of adjustments: For the year ended December 31, 2021, $14 million from MtM adjustment, $9 million from COVID-19 impacts and $3 million from merger costs. Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this report may relate to our future business and financial performance and future events or developments involving us and our subsidiaries that are not purely historical and may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

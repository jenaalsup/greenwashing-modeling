Safety The safety and well-being of our employees and contractors is our top priority and a core value. Our aim is to have an accident-free, incident-free workplace to ensure that everyone goes home safely every day. Therefore, we continuously evaluate and improve our personal and process safety procedures and diligently maintain our assets to reduce the risk of incidents. We also foster a strong safety culture across our company to ensure that our people are working toward this goal every day. SAFETY MANAGEMENT Our Board’s Sustainability Committee oversees matters relating to the health, safety and security of our employees and assets. Additionally, an executive Health, Environment, Safety and Security (HES&S) Management Committee meets quarterly and is responsible for evaluating performance and overseeing key health- and safety-related corporate policies. To read more about our HES&S management approach and systems, see Page 10 of this Report. 2018 was a year of significant growth and change for MPC as we strategically combined with Andeavor. We worked diligently to apply safety standards, expectations and consistent safety oversight across the newly combined organization. As part of our strategic combination, we also conducted thorough program and field assessments with defined plans for bringing the best of our two companies’ standards together and establishing integration expectations. Personal Safety Our personal safety standards comply with and often exceed local, state and federal regulations. Our employees and contractors are trained on our standards, and we conduct frequent audits and quality assurance visits to ensure compliance. Our safety culture is one that empowers everyone to create and maintain a safe and healthy workplace. In 2018, we achieved our lowest combined OSHA recordable incident rate across our Refining operations since 2014: 0.27 per 200,000 hours worked. Our Midstream and Retail segment rates increased to 0.76 and 1.99, respectively, while both remained below industry average incident rates. We continue to drive for ongoing safety improvements in our Midstream and Retail segments, with a goal of zero incidents. Safety | 13 MPC Refining OSHA Recordable Rate* MPLX OSHA Recordable Rate (incidents/200,000 hours) (incidents/200,000 hours) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2.4 0.7 2014 1.9 0.6 2015 1.5 0.6 2016 1.6 0.7 2017 2018 LIFE CRITICAL STANDARDS Our corporate approach to managing health and safety is designed to provide high-level requirements for the development of specific personal safety standards for various operating organizations and functions across our enterprise. We have extensive safety and environmental policies and procedures, including our Life Critical Standards, which address the personal safety hazards that can result in serious, or even fatal, injuries if not properly managed. Our Life Critical Standards include: . HOT WORK: addresses work that introduces ignition sources, such as welding, torching and grinding in close proximity to flammable materials. . CONFINED SPACE ENTRY: addresses work that requires personnel to enter confined spaces such as tanks and reactor vessels. . ENERGY ISOLATION: ensures equipment is safe to perform invasive work or maintenance by ensuring employees are protected from the unexpected re-energization or release of stored energy. . ELEVATED WORK: covers work that may be carried out at heights, including scaffolding, ladders and aerial-work platforms. All of our operating organizations adopt the Life Critical Standards that are relevant to their operations MPC employee at the company’s refinery in and the type of work they perform, as well as detailed St. Paul Park, Minnesota implementation plans specific to their facilities, processes and equipment. All of our standards are based on industry best practices and enforced through comprehensive training, audits and engagement from our leadership teams and internal subject matter experts. We also ensure the standards are regularly evaluated and updated. We enforce an Industrial Hygiene Standard designed to address any potential exposures to chemical, physical, biological and other hazards. The standard outlines controls, protective equipment and monitoring procedures to reduce the exposure risk to our people.   In addition to our training programs, we also conduct field and program audits to assess our compliance with all relevant internal standards and with the RC14001® Management System, which verifies that our internal management systems are of a high caliber and being effectively executed. For more information on RC14001 at MPC, see Page 10 of this Report. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 MPC Refining U.S. Refining avg** MPLX U.S. Midstream avg*** The OSHA Recordable Incident Rate is the number of incidents per 200,000 hours of work. MPC employees at the company’s refinery in Kenai, Alaska *Data includes employees and contractors.

The environment in which our Retail employees work is much different than that of Refining and Midstream, and therefore presents a different set of workplace hazards. As a result, we track our Retail safety data and management approach separately so that we can analyze performance and make necessary improvements to protect our Retail employees. Just like other aspects of our business, we strive for zero injuries in our Retail business so that our employees can go home safely every day. A dedicated safety expert is responsible for training and certifications and serves as a subject matter expert in each region.

We proactively manage our process safety risk by following industry best practices and continuously improving our process safety management systems. Among these systems are: . MECHANICAL INTEGRITY PROGRAM: Ensures equipment is proactively maintained in a safe and reliable manner to prevent operational failures that could impact the business, employees, contractors or the public. . MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE: Ensures changes in equipment, operating parameters, materials and procedures are properly reviewed so that concerns related to safety and health, technical limitations and equipment design are assessed and addressed prior to implementation. . SAFE WORK PRACTICES: Provide guidance for various safety-related tasks, including work permitting, hot work, energy isolation, confined space entry and opening process equipment or piping. The guidance is developed by each operating organization to ensure it is applicable to their operations. . OPERATING PROCEDURES: Provide clear instructions on how to operate covered process equipment including startup, normal and abnormal operations, emergency conditions and shutdown. The procedures include considerations such as health and safety, operating limits and safety systems involved in the process. In addition to these systems, we also conduct rigorous process safety assessments to identify risks and implement the appropriate safeguards, such as alarms, automated shutoff systems and relief devices. We classify process safety incidents using the guidelines set forth by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and track process safety consistent with API’s Recommended Practices 754, Process Safety Performance Indicators for the Refining and Petrochemical Industries. This practice includes reviewing both leading and lagging process safety metrics to better gauge our company’s performance and developing process safety improvement plans based on the data. Current areas of focus include: . Mechanical integrity, especially reducing loss of primary containment from small-bore piping . Improving human reliability through human-factors analysis and elimination of error traps In 2018, we worked toward integrating MPC’s and legacy Andeavor’s process safety management systems.

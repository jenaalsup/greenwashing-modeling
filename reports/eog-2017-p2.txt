HYDRAULIC FRACTURING Hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface. It enables EOG to produce crude oil and natural gas from formations that would otherwise not be recovered.Hydraulic fracturing technology has been safely used for decades in more than one million wells and is constantly being enhanced by the oil and gas industry. Studies conducted by respected regulators and authorities — including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Ground Water Protection Council, and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission — have verified that hydraulic fracturing is safe and non-threatening to human health and poses little or no risk to underground sources of drinking water. EOG takes numerous steps to conduct its hydraulic fracturing operations safely and responsibly, including:MINIMIZING CHEMICAL ADDITIVESWhile chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing are typically less than 1 percent, one of EOG’s ongoing goals is to further minimize the amount of chemicals required for hydraulic fracturing of its wells.WELLBORE INTEGRITY EOG actively works with trade associations and industry groups to assure that state regulations dealing with wellbore integrity remain up-to-date and take into account changing technology and best practices.SURFACE CASING EOG tests the surface casing integrity of each of its wells as part of our drilling operations prior to completing and flowing a well.ANNULAR PRESSURE To protect wellbore casing, EOG establishes a maximum allowable annular pressure (the pressure in the space around the wellbore) for each of the wells it operates and monitors this pressure. TRANSPARENCY EOG publicly discloses the fracturing fluid materials used for 100 percent of its well completions on the industry website FracFocus.org (hosted by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission).WATER MANAGEMENT EOG actively manages and conserves water resources in the communities where it operates and works with regulatory authorities to promote water conservation and efficiencies.EOG continues to test water reuse technologies, take steps to minimize overall water usage in the drilling and completion of wells, properly dispose of produced water, evaluate alternative sources of water and otherwise responsibly manage the water used, produced and disposed of during our operations.2017GALLONS OF WATER USED PER MMBTU OF ENERGY PRODUCED2.3201520162.82.3ENVIRONMENTALHOW WATER USE COMPARES According to the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Geological Survey, the quantity of water used in crude oil and natural gas operations is significantly less than the water used for the production of many other energy resources and for other industrial, agricultural, recreational and municipal purposes. While there are regional differences, the volume of water used for total U.S. crude oil and natural gas operations typically represents less than 1 to 5 percent of total water usage in the U.S.Water intensity is a commonly used metric for comparing the water consumption levels required to produce different energy sources. REGIONAL WATER ISSUES In addition to geologic differences, each producing region has unique needs and challenges when it comes to identifying sources of water, the ability to reuse water and methods for water disposal. Some basins have an abundance of water sources, but limited disposal facilities and other infrastructure. 
In other basins, climate and geographic conditions and the utilization of water for irrigation, electric power generation, industrial uses, and commercial, municipal and residential purposes results in greater competition for the sourcing and utilization of water. SOURCES OF WATER USED EOG uses various sources of water depending on the location of the producing basin. Water sources include surface water, potable and non-potable groundwater stored in aquifers and water produced along with hydrocarbons during operations. We also evaluate and use alternatives to traditional sources, such as the use of discharge water from industrial or municipal wastewater treatment plants. Throughout our operations, EOG attempts to minimize the use of water from sources that are also utilized for public drinking water. For example, in a number of basins in the United States, EOG is using non-potable water from aquifers that is not suitable for public drinking water. The availability of non-potable water differs from basin to basin.EOG management formed a special project team, with representatives from each of EOG’s U.S. operating areas, to accelerate implementation of best practices in water management. This project evaluated the full life cycle of water used in operations from acquisition through transportation, storage, treatment, flow-back, reuse and disposal. The focus of the team was to determine water quality needs, develop water source options and maximize reuse options.EOG is also working with a number of technology companies to develop water reuse technologies that can accommodate high volumes of produced water. In addition, EOG is conducting pilot projects using other technologies designed to recycle water for reuse. Each producing basin in North America has different challenges relating to geology, the geochemistry of the water and available infrastructure, and, therefore, different technologies are required in different basins.2.82.42.32.31.820132014201620152017Gallons of water used per MMBtu of energy produced17  2017 EOG RESOURCES              SUSTAINABILITY REPORTSPILL PREVENTION EOG continuously works to understand and manage the associated risks of waste and hazardous materials. Our goal is to progressively eliminate any risks posed to the community, environment, and EOG employees and contractors. EOG uses multiple means to prevent spills, including secondary containment on tanks. Pipeline leak detection systems are also monitored by EOG personnel to minimize response time in the event of an incident. Spill prevention plans are prepared and maintained by EOG staff across our operating areas. These plans include site-specific response measures and cover spill prevention, spill control, spill countermeasures, waste management and flowline integrity. Additionally, training is conducted to review the requirements of the plan and personnel responsibilities.As part of EOG’s ongoing commitment to environmentally responsible operations, EOG tracks and documents the volume and frequency of oil spills from its U.S. operations involving greater than five barrels, as well as the volumes of spilled oil we recover.0.0300.0250.0200.0150.0100.00500.0280.0180.0130.0100.0090.0100.0090.0040.0040.00420132017201620152014Oil Spill Rate(Bbls spilled for every MBoe produced in U.S. operations)*Oil Spill Rate after Accounting for Product Recovered (Bbls spilled for every MBoe produced in U.S. operations)***Calculated by dividing the aggregate volume of oil spills involving greater than five barrels of oil by annual MBoe production.**Calculated by dividing the aggregate volume of oil spills (after taking into account volumes of spilled oil subsequently recovered) by annual MBoe production.CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT Consistent with its commitment to transparency, EOG participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate change and water programs. EOG’s participation in these programs allows investors and the public to better understand the climate change–related aspects of EOG’s business and EOG’s water stewardship practices. These programs also allow EOG to benchmark its business and operations, which allows for improvement in the future.API ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERSHIP In December 2017, EOG joined the API Environmental Partnership, a landmark partnership of companies within the energy industry intended to accelerate improvements to environmental performance in operations across the country. One of the partnership’s goals is to accelerate emissions reductions. To accomplish this, it developed three specific initiatives, including: In addition to its programs, the Environmental Partnership will provide a platform for the industry to collaborate with stakeholders and share best management practices.A program for manual liquids unloading for natural gas production

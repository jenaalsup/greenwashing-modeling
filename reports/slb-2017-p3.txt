// LETTER FROM THE CEOPOWERING TODAY FOR PROSPERITY TOMORROWIn the midst of extraordinary events in 2020, challenges became opportunities, and the resilient character of our company and industry helped our communities begin to recover. Together, 
we are emerging stronger than ever. As a utility company and clean energy provider, we are frequently a first responder when 
disaster strikes, and this pandemic has been no exception. Thanks to the efforts of our more than 7,000 employees, our reliable electricity, gas and renewables generation was the engine that kept our cities, hospitals and communities energized.These times of crisis are also a call to action, particularly as we reflect on pressing issues like climate change. The challenges we have faced over the last year have made several things clear. First, the importance of investing in our future today and of strengthening 
our collective resiliency to address the challenges to come. And secondly, that through innovation and working together, we can accomplish amazing things.As we move forward, AVANGRID will continue to do its part to invest in infrastructure, sustainably rebuild our economy and create a cleaner, healthier future. Every step of the way, our actions will be guided by our Environmental, Social, Governance and Financial (ESG+F) sustainability framework, as a better and balanced way to do business – doing good by doing well for our customers, employees, communities and shareholders. The pages of this report, our fifth annual Sustainability Report, are a testament to this commitment.We aspire to be The Leading Sustainable Energy Company in the U.S. A bold goal, but one that is achievable. 
As the first utility to set a goal for carbon neutrality back in 2017, and as the third largest wind and solar 
operator* in the U.S., we are already leading the way toward a cleaner energy future – deploying wind and 
solar nationwide, investing in the future of offshore wind and building a stronger, more resilient grid that will serve as the backbone for this energy transition.Social investment is a key part of our purpose to create healthier, more sustainable communities every day. 
We believe we have a responsibility to help our communities grow and thrive, to take action to improve 
equality for all and to foster a more diverse and inclusive environment that is representative of all voices.A culture of strong, ethical governance drives how we operate our business at every level. We are proud to be recognized as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for three years running and listed by Forbes and JUST Capital as one of the 2021 JUST 100, an annual ranking of the most just U.S. public companies.Our focus on financial sustainability makes it all possible, enabling our growth and driving innovation. Built on our ESG+F strategy and our commitment to 
a cleaner and smarter energy future, we plan to grow faster in the next five years than we ever have, with a goal of delivering bottom-line annual earnings growth of 6%-8%** and investing over $20 billion. Through our major projects, AVANGRID is making significant investments in a cleaner energy future – 
generating financial and environmental benefits for all our stakeholders for years to come. We are also 
leading the emerging U.S. offshore wind industry and are poised to make history with our 800 MW joint 
venture Vineyard Wind 1, the nation’s first utility-scale offshore wind farm. Additionally, our New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) transmission project will bring 1.2 GW of clean hydropower from Quebec 
to New England, making it the largest clean energy project in the region. In 2020, we also announced a proposed merger with PNM Resources, a leading electric provider in New Mexico and Texas, with a goal to achieve 100% emissions-free energy by 2040. This strategic transaction will further our growth in both our clean energy distribution and transmission businesses and will help expand our 
growing leadership in renewables. The merger is also a great fit culturally, since the companies are built on strong commitments to ESG+F that include carbon neutrality goals. We expect to close the transaction by the end of 2021.I’m excited about AVANGRID’s future and the opportunities that lie ahead. We have ambitious goals, and I truly believe we’re in the right place at the right time in the energy transition. We are in the sweet spot: clean and connected. Our industry and our company will play a critical role as we strive to decarbonize the U.S. Now more than ever – by powering today for prosperity tomorrow – we are positioned to lead the way forward.I want to thank all of our employees for their unwavering commitment to our customers and communities, especially given the challenges related to COVID-19.Stay safe.Dennis V. Arriola
CEO// LETTER FROM THE CEOWe are in the 
sweet spot: clean 
and connected. *	IHS Markit “North American Wind & Solar Power Ownership Rankings: 2019 Trends & Review,” October 20, 2020**	Represents GAAP EPS and Adjusted EPS growth outlook, and reflects the impact of the pending merger with PNM Resources and related transaction costs, and includes AVANGRID projection of PNM Resources for 2022–2025 as of our November 5, 2020, Investor Day// AVANGRID’S SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS STRATEGY: ESG+FSUSTAINABLE BUSINESS STRATEGY: ESG+FESG goals are the framework by which we deliver our results. This report highlights our sustainable business model and strategy – ESG+F – structured around stewardship of the environment and society, driven by our governance and financial strength.As responsible investing continues to shape the 
market, it is widely understood that, at its core, 
the integration of environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) factors into business processes and decision-making not only benefits society, 
but also drives performance.At AVANGRID, we added financial stewardship 
– the F – to ESG because we believe that financial sustainability both promotes and is a result of an ESG-led strategy. We know we must also invest 
in the future today, using our ESG+F framework to help prioritize our investments in innovation, excellence and efficiency to benefit our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. 
We are also focused on maintaining a strong financial position from a balance sheet perspective, credit metrics and liquidity. In the energy transition, the strong will have more options and opportunities.In 2020, we furthered our commitment to 
sustainability by committing to additional reductions to our Scope 1* emissions intensity and reaching Scope 1 carbon neutrality by 2035, enhancing our supplier sustainability and minimizing the footprint of our fleet and facilities. And our inaugural listing by Forbes and JUST Capital as one of the 2021 JUST 100 recognizes that our strategy is vital to understanding our corporate purpose and communicating that to all our stakeholders.Transparency with our investors and stakeholders about our ESG+F commitments and achievements is critical. In addition to this report, AVANGRID continues 
to communicate ESG disclosures through the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index, Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) and the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and American Gas Association (AGA) ESG/Sustainability template reports, all 
of which are available in the Sustainability section of AVANGRID’s website at www.avangrid.com.*	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidanceCOVID-19 has impacted our economy in devastating ways and imposed financial hardship on many of 
our customers. Our companies suspended shut-offs for nonpayment, as well as late-payment fees 
and security deposits. We communicated these 
measures to customers and encouraged them to reach out to our Customer Care team to make 
alternative payment arrangements reflecting their economic circumstance and to get help identifying 
supportive resources to assist them.AVANGRID and the Avangrid Foundation committed 
$2.5 million to COVID-19 response and recovery efforts at the national, state and local levels. Our 
companies also donated 31,000 protective masks to 
hospitals in the areas where they operate. We continue to work with our regulators and community partners to find ways to ease the impact of the pandemic, 
particularly for our most vulnerable customers.During the pandemic, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has been our primary focus and paramount to our ability to continue to safely deliver reliable electric and gas service to our customers across our operating companies. We activated our emergency response and business continuity plans and worked with federal, state and local authorities to provide a coordinated response during this unprecedented crisis.A CLOSER LOOK: PROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR CUSTOMERS
In January 2020, before COVID-19 reached pandemic status, AVANGRID was monitoring the newly 
discovered coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and preparing to activate a pandemic plan to protect the health
and safety of our employees and the communities 
AVANGRID serves.  By the time COVID-19 reached pandemic status in March 2020, AVANGRID had moved swiftly to 
develop collaborative plans with every function, 
including Environmental, Health & Safety, HR, IT, Fleet & Facilities Management, Legal, Security and Regulatory, to develop risk reduction plans across the company.  We immediately activated a 24/7 COVID-19 
employee hotline to field reports and concerns 
from employees. This team developed a robust 
contact tracing and notification procedure to track and monitor all confirmed and potential cases 
across the organization. This process ensures that employees exposed or potentially exposed to COVID-19 act quickly and appropriately to protect themselves, their colleagues and communities, 
and that workplace re-entry happens only after it’s safe to return when work from home is not possible.  AVANGRID rapidly developed and implemented new 
procedures and best practices, aligned with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, designed to 
prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. 
Transparency and frequent communication were key in helping our employees adjust to new ways of 
working and the uncertainty of the health and safety of themselves and their families. We did this through daily email updates, town hall meetings with leadership and with health experts, and direct emails to employees whenever a positive case was identified in their region.  Due to the need to perform work in the field and our communities, AVANGRID’s field workforce was 
identified as a high-risk population. AVANGRID developed extensive personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance, procured critical supplies to support 
specific activities and activated a customer screening process to protect workers entering people’s homes. The company’s fleet team expanded our work 
vehicle inventory significantly to enable one-person-to-a-vehicle guidelines. To help prevent COVID-19 spread at office sites, AVANGRID orchestrated an efficient migration of nearly 60% of its workforce to remote work, supported 
with strengthened technology capabilities and 
access to workstations and ergonomic guidance.  When certain critical functions returned to the 
workplace in summer 2020, the company 
published an extensive, dynamic guide to new 
safety measures, including new PPE and social 
distancing requirements, as well as heightened 
travel restrictions. To further protect its workforce, 
AVANGRID instituted mandatory wellness checks and temperature screens in August for all employees reporting into the workplace or the field. To promote employee self-protection and symptom monitoring, AVANGRID sent cloth face coverings and a personal thermometer to every employee’s home.  As 2020 drew to a close, AVANGRID focused on reducing the virus’ spread and commenced planning for the COVID-19 vaccination phase and an eventual safe and healthy re-entry to the workplace. AVANGRID FOUNDATION: STEPPING UP TO 
HELP NEIGHBORS IN NEED DURING THE 
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Through our philanthropic arm, the Avangrid 
Foundation, and through our employee giving 
and matching programs, we have been there for 
communities in need to provide humanitarian
relief – from Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma to wildfires, tornadoes and other natural disasters.
The COVID-19 pandemic was a new kind of
humanitarian crisis, with widespread health, 
social and economic impacts. With collaboration as the driver and immediate relief the goal, the Foundation committed $1 million – its single largest charitable donation to date – to national and regional organizations doing critical work on the pandemic’s front lines. The Foundation’s donations formed part of a larger $2.5 million response from AVANGRID to provide support directly to the 
communities served by its eight Northeast utilities and Avangrid Renewables. A donation of $1.5 million in corporate funds from the AVANGRID companies responded to needs at the local level. Foundation giving was designed to intertwine with local giving, ensuring the joint response was balanced, complementary and comprehensive.OUR NATIONAL PARTNERS

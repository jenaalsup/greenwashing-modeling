Managing Climate-Related Risks
Our climate-related risk management process is designed to drive appropriate action for adapting to a range of possible futurescenarios. Through integrated planning and decision-making, we develop mitigation plans for climate-related risk, trackperformance against our goals and adjust our plans as we learn and conditions evolve.Local risks and opportunities related to our operations and projects are assessed and managed at the BU level, enabling tailoredbusiness goals to address the challenges and opportunities unique to each region’s operations. Reporting and overarchingclimate-related risks, such as GHG target-setting and prioritization of global emissions-abatement projects, are managed at thecorporate level.2ConocoPhillipsGrissik Gas Plant, South SumatraThe diagram below shows a simplified process flow of our climate-related risk management process.Corporate Strategy Our corporate strategy and the embedded Climate Risk Strategy are informed by the output of our corporate scenarios and therisk management system. Examples of impacts on our corporate strategy include:Reducing the sustaining price of the company — the equivalent oil price at which we can sustain production and pay ourdividend.Lowering the cost of supply to manage market risk and improve returns.Maintaining a diversified portfolio of projects and opportunities.Diversifying our portfolio to include assets with lower decline rates and low capital intensity to drive higher free cash flowyields.Developing technologies that reduce both costs and emissions.Monitoring alternative energy technologies.The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company torespond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction,alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition,emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy andfinance sector engagement.Read more about our emissions reduction targets.Long-Range PlanThe ConocoPhillips Long-Range Plan provides the data thatunderlies our corporate strategy and enables us to test ourportfolio of projects against our climate-related risk scenarios,and thus make better-informed strategic decisions.We use a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) process tocollect potential GHG emissions reduction projects from ourbusiness units, prioritize them based on their cost and reductionvolume, and implement the most cost-effective projects. As aresult, we have completed the installation of non-condensablegas co-injection in the Canadian oil sands to enhanceproduction while reducing energy consumption and emissions.In the U.S. Lower 48, we have changed the design of some newfacilities to include instrument air packages rather than gas-driven devices, reducing methane emissions from those sites. Tocontinue those reductions, we have set up regional teams inNorth America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Europe to use theMACC process to identify additional energy efficiency projects.Output from the MACC informs our annual budget, Long-RangePlan and technology strategy.ConocoPhillips

CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY Carbon Asset Risk Assessment Ever since the second half of 2014, energy commodity markets have been defined by significant levels of volatility. From levels of over $100 per barrel between early 2011 and mid-2014, Brent oil prices fell to around $25 per barrel in early 2016, before rebuilding to the current range in 2019 of around $60 to $75 per barrel. Tight oil has revolutionized the supply side of the business, and the issue of decarbonization has risen to greater prominence. An energy transition to a lower-carbon economy appears to be underway, but there are multiple pathways to achieve this transition, which creates some uncertainty as to the pace and scale of change. Climate-related issues have evolved from an environmental concern to also include financial considerations. Our stakeholders have expressed an interest in understanding how HessÕ oil and gas portfolio might be impacted by a transition to a lower-carbon economy. To help quantify climate-related risks and opportunities Ð and address investor concerns Ð many companies are using scenario planning as a tool to assess portfolio resilience over the long term. Scenarios allow the testing of a variety of alternative views of the market as a means to identify areas of potential risk and opportunity worthy of further, more detailed analysis and monitoring. The scenario approach allows companies to communicate to their investors that they understand and have considered future risks and opportunities, which are derived from modeled changes in energy demand, the potential emergence of new technologies, and proposed changes by policymakers to curb GHG emissions. Because the TCFD recommends transparency around key parameters, assumptions and analytical choices, Hess has chosen to model the three main scenarios detailed in the IEAÕs 2018 World Energy Outlook (WEO) against our own base case, which is explained later in this section. Furthermore, the TCFD recommends that organizations use a 2¡C or lower scenario to test portfolio resilience Ð in other words, a scenario under which global warming is kept to within 2¡C of preindustrial levels. Such scenarios usually feature reductions in demand for oil, natural gas and coal; growth in clean technologies; and a reshaping of trade flows, among other assumptions. The Sustainable Development scenario in the IEAÕs 2018 WEO (discussed further below), which is part of HessÕs modeling, fits within this recommendation. Considerations for Scenario Planning In 2018 Hess senior management approved a scenario planning study to test the resilience of our portfolio against various views of the market. This exercise established a range of energy supply and demand; oil, natural gas and carbon prices; and emissions estimates that are projected to prevail under different publicly available, long-term scenarios for environmental policy and market conditions. Scenario planning can be approached in a stepwise fashion. For Hess, the first step was to assess transition risks under divergent oil, natural gas and carbon price trajectories. In the next iteration of this analysis, we plan to consider expanding it to include looking at physical risks to our business (e.g., infrastructure) and reputational risk. Going forward, we plan to incorporate carbon asset risk assessment via scenario planning into our regular business planning cycle. To evaluate potential exposure to our portfolio in a modeled carbon-constrained future, we began by considering the long-range outlook for energy supply and demand. We used the IEAÕs 2018 WEO to examine various supply and demand scenarios through 2040 (see www.iea.org/weo2018/). These scenarios are recognized as an industry benchmark worldwide, and are, therefore, an appropriate choice for an oil and gas producer such as Hess. The 2018 World Energy Outlook s Three Main Scenarios ¥ Current Policies Ð the business-as-usual case ¥ New Policies Ð incorporates existing energy policy as well as an assessment of the results likely to stem from the implementation of announced policy intentions (chiefly the Nationally Determined Contributions Ð i.e., the emission reductions agreed to by individual countries under the Paris Agreement) ¥ Sustainable Development Ð reflects a pathway to achieving key energy-related components of the U.N. Sustainable Development Agenda, including universal access to modern energy by 2030, urgent action to tackle climate change and measures to improve poor air quality; and is fully aligned with the Paris AgreementÕs aim to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2¡C Note: While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report in October 2018 that suggests that net emissions of carbon dioxide must fall 45 percent by 2030 and reach Ònet zeroÓ by 2050 to limit global temperature rise to below 1.5¡C, the IEA has yet to develop energy demand scenarios that reflect the IPCCÕs assumption. Additionally, there are no known regulatory proposals for achieving the IPCCÕs suggestion. The charts just below depict the 2018 WEOÕs world energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions under the IEAÕs three main scenarios. In the New Policies scenario, which is the IEA's central scenario, worldwide energy use will grow approximately 25 percent between 2017 and 2040. Energy demand for oil and gas is projected to grow by 24 percent during the same period and account for 53 percent of the energy mix in 2040, down slightly from 54 percent today. The figure at the bottom of the page shows changes in global oil demand by sector in the IEAÕs New Policies scenario between 2017 and 2040. The chart illustrates that the expected electrification of the passenger vehicle fleet is more than offset by increased demand from the petrochemical, truck and aviation sectors, which will dominate future oil demand growth and continue to create robust demand for oil through the projection period. In the Sustainable Development scenario (consistent with limiting global temperature rise to less than 2¡C), worldwide energy use is projected to experience a modest decline of 2 percent through 2040. Oil and gas are expected to account for 48 percent of the energy mix, down from 54 percent today. The IEA has indicated that oil and gas are still critical to meeting the growing energy demand and that the challenges of achieving the Sustainable Development scenario are substantial, requiring a major reallocation of energy-sector investment capital. World Primary Energy Demand by Fuel, and Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, by IEA Scenario Current Policies New Policies Sustainable Development 5025 2000 2017 2025 2040 2000 2017 2025 2040 2000 2017 2025 2040 ÷ Coal ÷ Oil ÷ Gas ÷ Nuclear ÷ Renewables ÷ Solid Biomass Carbon Dioxide Emissions Global Oil Demand by Sector in the IEAÕs New Policies Scenario, 2017Ð2040 Petro-Power Buildings Other Cars Industry Shipping Aviation Trucks chemicals -6 .

This guidance establishes a specified methodology, which we describe below. The guidance also serves as a roadmap for our external verifier to review and verify that we followed our specified methodology when conducting the scenario analysis. HessÕ approach was to establish a base case (i.e., $65 per barrel Brent oil and $3 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) Henry Hub natural gas, in 2019 real terms) and then run our current asset portfolio and intended forward investments through this model to assess financial robustness. In addition, we applied a sustained $40 per tonne cost of carbon to our assets and intended forward investments. HessÕ base case was then compared against the various oil, natural gas and carbon prices in the IEAÕs three main scenarios: Current Policies, New Policies and Sustainable Development. While we included the three IEA cases in our analysis, the Current Policies scenario is not discussed in our disclosure that follows, as it only considers the impact from current legislation and does not include the likely effects of announced policies, including the Nationally Determined Contributions made for the Paris Agreement. The three charts below show the oil, natural gas and CO2 prices under the IEAÕs New Policies and Sustainable Development scenarios and HessÕ base case. As these charts show, there is a wide divergence in oil, natural gas and carbon prices between the two IEA scenarios. For Hess, oil and natural gas prices (and the underlying demand that drives them) are likely to be the most immediate concern, while the impact of carbon pricing is also relevant. Our next step was to quantify the financial impact (delta) between the Hess base case and the IEA scenarios. The TCFD recommends that once a 2¡C scenario is established, companies should define a base case or business-as-usual outlook for the future. The base case should use the same metrics as the 2¡C scenario (e.g., oil demand, carbon prices and other market factors) and share the same fundamental economic foundations. Establishing multiple scenarios allows measurement of the delta between metrics at future points to properly understand the envelope within which risk and opportunity may occur. COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY Results of the Hess Scenario Planning Exercise We have tested the robustness of HessÕ asset portfolio and intended forward investments under multiple scenarios, including the IEAÕs Sustainable Development scenario. We note that the latter is fully aligned with the Paris AgreementÕs aim of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2¡C. At the oil, natural gas and carbon prices established in our base case, the Hess portfolio remains resilient, and our pipeline of forward intended investments provides strong financial returns even under the Sustainable Development scenario, the IEAÕs most challenging scenario in terms of GHG emission reductions. While the Sustainable Development scenario projects lower oil demand in the 2040 timeframe, the IEA states that Òcontinued investment in oil and gas supply...remains essential even in the Sustainable Development scenario to 2040, as decline rates at existing fields leave a substantial gap that needs to be filled with new upstream projectsÓ (2018 World Energy Outlook, page 51). Crude Oil Price Natural Gas Price CO2 Price 200 8 160 Dollars per MMBtu, 2019 Real TermsU.S. Dollars per Barrel, 2019 Real TermsU.S. Dollars per Tonne, 2019 Real TermsU.S.150 6 120 80100 4 Hess IEA New Polices IEA Sustainable Development 50 2 40 0  0  0  2019  2024  2029  2034  2039  2019  2024  2029  2034  2039  2019  2024  2029  2034  2039  44  However, with potentially lower oil demand, competition may intensify, and some high-cost producers may be forced out of the marketplace. We believe our scenario analysis validates HessÕ strategic priorities (as shown in the figure on the previous page) to focus investment on high-return, low-cost oil and gas opportunities and to build a focused and balanced portfolio, robust at low prices Ð thereby providing competitive levels of returns to our shareholders. We believe this strategy is consistent with the IEAÕs Sustainable Development scenario, which envisions a meaningful role for oil and gas through 2040, when oil and gas are still projected to account for almost 50 percent of global primary energy demand. Seventy-five percent of our investment capital through 2025 is planned to be allocated to our assets in Guyana and the Bakken, where we have a deep inventory of investment opportunities with predicted exceptional returns. Our discovery in Guyana (where Hess has a 30 percent interest in the Stabroek Block) is among the industryÕs largest offshore oil discoveries in the past 10 years. The Liza Phase 1 development is projected to breakeven at $35 per barrel Brent oil, and the Liza Phase 2 development is projected to breakeven at $25 per barrel Brent oil. These are anticipated to be the lowest breakeven costs for the industryÕs top 50 offshore developments and shale plays (source: RS Energy Group, Offshore First Class: The L.I.Z.A Framework, January 2018). As a result of the low breakeven costs in Guyana and aggressive cost-reduction activities in the Bakken, we plan to structurally lower our cash flow breakeven cost to less than $40 per barrel Brent portfolio breakeven by 2025, so that even if the market experiences reduced oil demand under the IEAÕs Sustainable Development scenario, Hess is well positioned to retain our share in the marketplace as a low-cost producer. Finally, using the lowest oil demand growth rate from the IEAÕs Sustainable Development scenario, oil demand is still projected to be 70 million barrels per day in 2040. However, as the chart above right illustrates, without any new investment, oil production would halve by 2025. The IEA has repeatedly flagged that there has been substantial underinvestment in future oil supply since oil prices began their decline in 2014. This mismatch between strong Million Barrels of Oil per Day Oil Production with No New Investment from 2018 and Demand in the New Policies and Sustainable Development Scenarios 120 100 80 60 40 20 IEA New Policies Natural Gas Liquids Extra Heavy Oil and BitumenIEA Sustainable Development OtherConventional Tight Oil oil demand in the near term and a shortfall in new projects risks a sharp tightening of oil markets in the 2020s. The IEA estimates that almost $13 trillion of total oil and gas investment will be needed for oil and natural gas supply between 2018 and 2040 to support the Sustainable Development scenario. In summary, based on the results of our scenario planning analysis, we believe it is highly unlikely that any of our assets would be stranded or significantly impaired by the CO2 pricing under the most ambitious of the IEA scenarios Ð the Sustainable Development scenario, which is consistent with the aim of the Paris Agreement. Oil will continue to remain a key part of the worldÕs energy solution for many decades to come (2018 World Energy Outlook, page 27); and, based on this exercise and HessÕ strategic priority of being among the lowest-cost oil producers, we believe that during the projected period we can continue to monetize our reserves and deliver robust financial performance under a wide range of market conditions. 2018 Hess Proved Reserves by Region* 1,192 Million Barrels of Oil Equivalent *HessÕ proved reserves consist of 75 percent liquids (light and medium crude oils, condensate and natural gas liquids) and 25 percent natural gas. 2018 Hess Proved Reserves by Resource Type** ÷ Unconventional ÷ Conventional (Including Acid Gas) ÷  Deepwater **Deepwater is a conventional resource, but it is shown separately here to provide more clarity on our reserve base.

This 21 percent carbon intensity reduction figure is derived from the Sustainable Development scenarioÕs CO2 emissions divided by primary world energy demand in 2030 versus 2017. HessÕ 25 percent GHG intensity reduction target, referenced intensity and 50 percent flaring intensity reduction targets, and therefore no change is planned for those targets. In the next section, where we discuss GHG performance, we reference our absolute emission reductions year over year, which include the divested assets. We also provide our restated 2014Ð2018 performance, which removes the 2017Ð 2018 divestitures, to allow for comparison against our established targets. GREENHOUSE GAS PERFORMANCE We report GHG emissions from our oil and Protection Agency (EPA) in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart C). The remaining 5 percent of our reported operated GHG emissions are from a variety of noncombustion and fugitive emission sources such as storage tanks, compressor seals, pneumatic pumps and valves. For such sources at onshore facilities, we use the emission factors prescribed by the U.S. EPA in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W). Hess uses other appropriate regulatory or industry-specific factors to estimate fugitive emissions for all other facilities. We also report indirect emissions associated with purchased electricity (Scope 2) and other indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Operated Emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) In 2018, of the estimated 3.9 million tonnes of gross GHG emissions reported from our operated oil and gas assets, 3.6 million tonnes were Scope 1 emissions, primarily from flaring and fuel combustion, and approximately 0.3 million tonnes were Scope 2 emissions, from purchased electricity. Process operations (primarily fuel combustion) and flaring accounted for 43 percent and 52 percent of our Scope 1 GHG emissions, respectively. In 2018 our absolute GHG emissions decreased by 0.2 million tonnes compared with 2017, due primarily to a reduction of 1.1 million tonnes from the sale of our assets in Equatorial Guinea and the Permian Basin. This decrease was partially offset by increased emissions of a reported 0.5 million tonnes in our North Dakota operations, a reported 0.2 million tonnes in our North Malay Basin operations and a reported 0.2 million tonnes in our Gulf of Mexico operations, all related primarily to an overall 30 percent increase in production year over year. Our restated GHG emissions intensity (i.e., tonnes of emissions per thousand barrels of oil equivalent (BOE)) decreased by 17 percent in 2018 versus our 2014 baseline. This cumulative improvement keeps us on track to achieve our 25 percent emissions intensity reduction target for 2020. Equity Emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Since 2007 Hess has tracked GHG emissions from our operated and nonoperated oil and gas assets based on our equity interest. The graphs at right detail our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from 2008 to 2018 on an equity basis. These graphs show that over the past 11 years we have reduced our absolute Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions from 10.8 million tonnes of CO2e to 3.9 million tonnes, or 64 percent. During the same period, Scope 3 equity emissions decreased from 114 million tonnes to 43 million tonnes of CO2e, or 62 percent. In total, over this period, our combined Scope 1, 2 and 3 absolute CO2e emissions have been reduced by 62 percent through a combination of emission reduction initiatives, asset sales and refinery shutdowns. Scopes 1 and 2 Equity Emissions Our major source of Scope 1 and 2 emissions from nonoperated oil and gas assets in 2018 was from the A-18 Block in the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area. Our equity emissions from this asset were approximately 1.3 million tonnes. Major sources of emissions from our operated assets in 2018 included those from the North Dakota production asset, the Tioga Gas Plant and offshore Gulf of Mexico, which altogether accounted for an estimated 2.1 million tonnes of equity emissions. Our other operated and nonoperated assets made up the balance of equity emissions at an estimated 0.5 million tonnes. Equity Greenhouse Gas  Emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by Country Million Tonnes CO2e 10.8 10 8 6 5.5 4.2 4.0 3.94 2 0 2008 2015 2016 2017 2018 . U.K. .

Unlike fully integrated oil companies that are positioned to offer a full range of energy products and services to third-party customers, Hess, as a pure-play exploration and production company, has no direct control over our Scope 3 emissions. Nevertheless, we disclose these data on an equity basis. This year, we have restated our historical Scope 3 emissions to follow the methodology established by IPIECA in its 2016 report Estimating Petroleum Industry Value Chain (Scope 3) Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This guidance, which is currently the industry standard, is based on the World Resources InstituteÕs and World Business Council for Sustainable DevelopmentÕs Scope 3 guidance. Per the IPIECA guidance, we report Scope 3 emissions for category 11 ÒUse of Sold ProductsÓ by calculating combustion emissions for our oil, natural gas and marketed oil products. We also report Scope 3 category 10 ÒProcessing of Sold ProductsÓ emissions, which result from refining of our crude oil production by others. In 2018 we sold 553 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of natural gas, which, when used by customers, accounted for an estimated 11 million Although not material, we also track and report Scope 3 emissions associated with employee business travel. Combined emissions from employee business travel via commercial air carrier and rail in 2018 were about 3,200 tonnes of CO2e, down approximately 30 percent compared with last year, as a result of reduced employee travel. Carbon Offsets As an element of our EHS & SR strategy, we have purchased carbon credits annually since 2010 to offset at least 100 percent of our Scope 3 business travel emissions (approximately 3,200 tonnes in 2018). We recently increased this commitment by also offsetting 100 percent of our Scope 1 emissions associated with operating the companyÕs truck fleet, aviation activities (aircraft and helicopters) and personal and rental vehicle miles driven while on company business (approximately 11,800 tonnes in 2018). We purchased 15,000 tonnes of carbon credits from First Climate Markets AG, for the retirement of offsets related to a third-party landfill gas recovery project in Ohio. This contribution offset 100 percent of the GHG emissions we estimate were generated from our business travel in 2018 (Scopes 1 and 3). Hess Flaring Rates 99 99 300100 EMISSION REDUCTION INITIATIVES In support of our GHG emission and flaring intensity reduction targets, we track and monitor air emissions at each of our assets and undertake a variety of emission reduction initiatives. Our efforts focus on our largest-emitting facilities and on opportunities that are technically and economically feasible and where we are able to achieve stakeholder approval. Flaring In 2018 flaring from Hess-operated assets totaled 51 MMSCFD, a decrease of 9 MMSCFD compared with 2017. This decrease was primarily related to reduced flaring of 21 MMSCFD from asset sales in Equatorial Guinea, Ohio and West Texas, and partially offset by increased flaring of 11 MMSCFD in North Dakota. On an intensity basis, we have reduced our cumulative flaring intensity by 41 percent through 2018, compared with our 2014 baseline. While our flaring intensity remained essentially flat between 2017 and 2018, we are still on track to achieve our 50 percent reduction target by 2020. Our flaring increase in North Dakota was primarily related to enhanced completion techniques in 2018 that increased and accelerated the productivity of our wells, as well as a 30 percent increase in the number of wells brought online in 2018 (from approximately 70 in 2017 to 100 in 2018).

In 2018 the rate of gas capture by third-party gathering and processing facilities was significantly less than expected. We project an increase in third-party gathering and processing capacity in 2019. Through our subsidiary Hess Midstream Partners LP, we are committed to and are aggressively executing significant capital investment projects to increase gas capture rates in the region, including installation of gas capture units from GTUIT (discussed further below) and ColdStream, additional compression capability through brownfield and greenfield projects, and construction of the Little Missouri Four Gas Plant (LM4) through a joint venture with Targa Resources. Between 2012 and 2018, approximately $3 billion was invested in midstream infrastructure in North Dakota to capture and monetize natural gas produced from our operations and minimize flaring. In 2018 Hess Midstream Partners LP invested an additional $334 million for continued expansion of the Bakken midstream gas gathering infrastructure, including additional gas compression facilities, natural gas liquid (NGL) and gas gathering lines and construction of LM4. Approximately 31 MMSCFD of additional compression, along with high-pressure and low-pressure gas gathering lines, were added throughout the Bakken region. We are planning and executing continued expansion of the Bakken midstream gas gathering infrastructure, including additional gas compression facilities and NGL and gas gathering lines, in 2019 and beyond. Approximately 100 MMSCFD of additional third-party gas processing capacity, through LM4, is expected to become available in 2019. In addition, 92 MMSCFD of additional compression is expected to be brought online throughout Offshore Operations, Gulf of Mexico  2019. Longer-term gas gathering and processing investments are being evaluated for future approval. These midstream infrastructure projects will leave Hess well positioned to reduce flaring intensity by 2020 in line with our target. Natural Gas Capture Using technology developed through our partnership with GTUIT Ð a designer, manufacturer and operator of well site natural gas capture and NGL extraction equipment Ð we are recovering high-BTU CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY gas from locations in North Dakota that were previously flaring this raw, wet natural gas. The GTUIT equipment successfully addresses some of the technical challenges associated with capturing NGLs from the Bakken gas Ð the units are modular and mobile, they can operate reliably unmanned and they can adapt to the ever-changing flow conditions of the well and the changing chemistry of the associated gas. In 2018 we operated 13 of these mobile units (9 MMSCFD of capacity), allowing us to capture 6 million gallons of NGLs. As a result, more than 420 MMSCF of gas flaring was avoided, and CO2e emissions were  reduced by an estimated 37,378 tonnes. Energy Use Thousand Gigajoules 40,000 38,246 35,000 30,000 25,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 . Direct .  Indirect 2018 Energy Use by Country Thousand Gigajoules .

This project provides dual economic and environmental benefits, as it converts gas into marketable products as well as reduces the amount of gas flared and the associated air emissions. See additional examples of emission reduction initiatives at hess.com/ sustainability/climate-change-energy/ emission-reduction-initiatives ENERGY USE Reducing our energy use has the dual benefit of lowering costs and GHG emissions, and it is a central focus of both our EHS & SR strategy and our Lean approach to managing the business. We generate and purchase energy primarily for power, processing, heating and cooling. In 2018 energy consumption from Hess-operated assets was approximately 31 million gigajoules, 7 percent lower than in 2017. This decrease was primarily related to reduced energy use resulting from asset sales in Equatorial Guinea and the Permian Basin and partially offset by increased energy use in our North Dakota, North Malay Basin and Gulf of Mexico operations related to a 30 percent production increase. Eighty-two percent of HessÕ energy use was directly generated from our operations, primarily at the Tioga Gas Plant and at our production facilities in North Dakota, North Malay Basin, Denmark and the Gulf of Mexico. The remaining 18 percent was indirect energy (energy used by utilities to provide net purchased electricity) purchased for the North Dakota production operations and the Tioga Gas Plant. We seek opportunities to promote energy efficiency where feasible. As one example, we have been working to streamline the management of flights to our offshore assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Over the past five years our aviation contractors have moved more passengers while reducing the number of flights by 35 percent and reducing overall flying hours by 25 percent. This emphasis on improved logistics and flight management in the Gulf of Mexico operations has resulted in a reduction in fuel usage of approximately 103,000 gallons between 2017 and 2018, resulting in a reduction of approximately 1,000 tonnes of CO2e. This represents approximately 13 percent of HessÕ CO2e emissions from aviation fuels, excluding the Hess charter operated by United Airlines. In 2018 our U.S. operations accounted for all of our purchased electricity Ð approximately 600,000 megawatt hours (MWh), or a 23 percent decrease from last year, primarily attributable to the sale of the Seminole Gas Plant (as part of the Permian Basin asset). Based on U.S. electricity generation profiles, we estimate that approximately 27 percent of this electricity was generated from renewable sources, primarily wind power. We also support renewable energy through the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs) equivalent to at least 10 percent of the net electricity used in our operations. In 2018 we purchased 70,000 Green-e Energy certified RECs for wind power, equivalent to 70,000 MWh or about 12 percent of the electricity purchased for our operated exploration and production assets. In total, including the RECs, approximately 39 percent of our indirect energy use came from renewable sources. In 2019 we are expanding our support of renewable energy by purchasing enough RECs to offset 100 percent of our purchased electricity. See more detail on our purchased electricity use at hess.com/sustainability/climate.change-energy/energy-use Managing Methane Emissions The advancement in shale energy technology in recent years has resulted in an increased supply of abundant, low-cost natural gas. The clean-burning characteristics of natural gas can play a critical role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Although natural gas burns cleaner than other fuels, there is considerable debate about fugitive methane leakage along the natural gas value chain, which may have the potential to reduce its climate benefits. Stakeholder interest in this issue has continued in recent years, and in 2016 the U.S. EPA and the Bureau of Land Management finalized several regulations aimed at controlling fugitive methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. However, those regulations are now subject to administrative reconsideration as well as litigation challenges. Industry generally maintains that these regulations are largely unnecessary, as methane emissions have decreased at a time of growth in natural gas production and it is in industryÕs best interest to monetize gas to generate additional revenue. One element of our EHS & SR strategy has been to pursue voluntary reductions in methane emissions. As a result, Hess became a founding member of the ONE Future Coalition, a group of companies from across the natural gas industry focused on identifying policy and technical solutions that yield continuous improvement in the management of methane emissions associated with the production, processing, transportation and distribution of natural gas. ONE Future offers a performance-based, flexible approach that is expected to yield significant reductions in methane emissions. The goal is to voluntarily lower methane emissions to less than 1 percent of gross methane production across the U.S. value chain by 2025. ONE Future has also set interim 2020 sectoral targets. Peer-reviewed analyses indicate that a leak/loss rate of 1 percent or less across the U.S. natural gas value chain provides immediate GHG reduction benefits. To achieve this goal, ONE Future has established methane emission rate targets for each sector of the natural gas value chain: production (0.28 percent), gathering and boosting  (0.09 percent), processing (0.11 percent), transmission and storage (0.30 percent) and distribution (0.22 percent), which cumulatively total to the 1 percent target. In 2017 the ONE Future membersÕ cumulative methane emissions intensity was 0.55 percent across the U.S. onshore natural gas value chain. Hess has activities in three of the ONE Future sectors: production, gathering and boosting, and processing. In 2018 our methane emissions rate for production was 0.45 percent, for gathering and boosting it was 0.20 percent and for processing it was 0.04 percent. Our onshore U.S. methane intensity was 0.69 percent, which is slightly above the ONE Future combined 2020 interim target of 0.64 percent for those three sectors. Our relative methane intensity increased in 2018 due to the sale of our joint-venture interests in the Utica shale play. With our planned reductions to flaring and the phaseout of high-bleed pneumatic controllers in North Dakota, we anticipate that we will achieve the ONE Future targets by 2025. Our combined U.S. methane emissions intensity across our onshore and offshore operations was 0.31 percent, while our global methane intensity in 2018 was 0.18 percent. In a related voluntary effort, in 2017 Hess became one of the initial participants in the American Petroleum InstituteÕs Environmental Partnership. A key activity of the Environmental Partnership is furthering action to reduce air emissions, including methane and VOCs, associated with natural gas and oil production. To accomplish this, the Environmental Partnership developed three separate Environmental Performance Programs for participating companies to implement and phase into their operations starting January 1, 2018. Hess is implementing the two programs applicable to our operations in North Dakota, as follows: ¥ Leak Program for Natural Gas and Oil Production Sources: Participants will implement monitoring and timely repair of fugitive emissions at selected sites utilizing detection methods and technologies such as U.S. EPA Method 21 or optical gas imaging cameras. Hess conducted semiannual surveys at 407 sites in 2018. ¥ Program to Replace, Remove or Retrofit High-Bleed Pneumatic Controllers: Participants will replace, remove or retrofit high-bleed pneumatic controllers with low- or zero-emitting devices within five years. Hess has identified 246 high-bleed pneumatic controllers remaining in our North Dakota operations. We plan to phase these out by 2022. The third program, involving manual liquids unloading for natural gas production sources, is not applicable to Hess, as we do not currently operate any natural gas-only production wells. In addition to these programs, the Environmental Partnership will provide a platform for industry to collaborate with stakeholders and learn from one another. In order to meet both our ONE Future and Environmental Partnership commitments, in 2018 we continued implementation of our leak detection and repair (LDAR) program across all of our production facilities (existing and new) in North Dakota and Ohio (now sold) and at the Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota. Further detail on our LDAR program is provided in the Environment section of this report and at hess.com/sustainability/environment Methane Emissions Intensity  SECTOR  ONE Future 2025 Target  ONE Future 2020 Target  Hess 2018 Performance  U.S. Onshore Production U.S. Onshore Gathering and Boosting U.S. Onshore Processing U.S. Onshore Upstream (Production, Gathering, Boosting and Processing) U.S. Onshore and Offshore Upstream Global Upstream  0.28 0.09 0.11 0.47 NA NA  0.38 0.08 0.18 0.64 NA NA  0.45 0.20 0.04 0.69 0.31 0.18  Note: Data exclude Utica production, which was divested in 2018.

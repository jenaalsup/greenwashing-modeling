OIL AND PRODUCED WATER SPILLS & RECOVERY EOG tracks and documents the volume and frequency of oil and produced water spills from our U.S. operations, as well as the volumes of oil and produced water we recover from those spills. We also consider our oil spill rate performance in our executive compensation program. EOG has historically reported oil spills greater than five barrels, because it is the most common regulatory spill reporting threshold for our primary operating areas. While we continue that practice, for 2020, we are also dis.closing oil and produced water spills greater than one barrel to be more consistent with industry peer reporting. For more information regarding our spill metrics, including the relevant definitions and the regulatory oil spill reporting requirements (i.e., volume thresholds) for our primary operating areas, see the Appendix and the Data Tear Sheet. Our oil spill rate for spills greater than five barrels was 0.006 in 2020, decreasing by 33 percent from 2019. For 2020, we recovered 66 percent of oil from spills over five barrels and 64 percent of oil from spills over one barrel. We also recovered 62 percent of the total volume of our produced water spills over one barrel. Oil Spill Rates and Recovery 0.047 0.041 0.009 0.0080.006 0.006 0.007 0.004 0.005 0.002 0.002 0.003 2018* 2019 2020 2020 Spills Over Five Barrels Spills Over One Barrel # Oil Spill Rate (Bbls Spilled per Mboe Produced) ÷ Recovered Oil Rate (Spilled Bbls Recovered per Mboe Produced) ÷ Unrecovered Oil Rate (Spilled Bbls Not Recovered per Mboe Produced) * Higher rate resulted from a spill caused by a mechanical issue at a single well facility In Focus Automating Spill Prevention and Management To support our efforts to prevent and minimize oil and pro.duced water spills in our operations, EOG has developed a proprietary leak detection software that we call iDetectSM. We began implementing iDetect in our operations in 2019 and continue to roll it out where technically feasible. iDetect uses sensors to detect leaks in real time on flow lines, gathering systems and lay flat lines for temporary water transfers, including reuse water systems. If a potential leak is detected, iDetect sends a notification through an alarm system linked directly to the mobile devices of our field personnel, which includes a full description and quantification of the potential leak. We have integrated iDetect with our automation systems in our control rooms allowing Spill Prevention and Management Technology for remote interventions in our most active areas and shut downs if a leak is detected. Data provided by iDetect also helps with spill prevention by allowing us to evaluate the origins of leaks and better plan our operations, including facility and pipeline designs. By building iDetect in-house, we are able to regularly deploy new features and data enhancements. We are also able to inte.grate iDetect with our other applications, including our water management application TridentSM and our automated control systems, providing an efficient and comprehensive system for water and spill management that is adaptable to the unique conditions of our operating areas. Annual movement for the Ferruginous Hawk based on 2020 data from radio collars a raptor species that nests throughout the basin. Through a proposal devel.oped with and approved by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Wyoming Game & Fish Department, EOG has fitted 16 of these birds with GPS transmitters over the last seven years to provide real-time, year-round information on their movements and specific details on their breeding locations and migration patterns. This program has allowed us to better plan and manage our oper.ations and support the breeding and nesting of Ferruginous Hawks. BIODIVERSITY AND LAND STEWARDSHIP EOG is committed to environmental stewardship throughout the lifecycle of our operations, including by inte.grating habitat and wildlife conser.vation in the planning, management and restoration of our exploration and production activities. We work to avoid or minimize impacts to wildlife and abide by applicable laws and regulations related to biodiversity. By downsizing and centralizing our drilling and production facilities, and using directional and horizontal drilling technology with longer laterals, we are able to reduce our overall surface footprint. In addition, as part of our pre-development review process, we evaluate locations for environmental and related concerns, including protected species and critical habitats, waters of the U.S., and hydrology, and also evaluate for archaeological resources. We also partner with local stake.holders, including community groups, government agencies and academic institutions, at various stages of project development and operation to help conserve local habitat and wildlife. RECLAIMING AND RESTORING LAND Once all production activities are complete on a location, reclamation and restoration begin. Beyond our legal, regulatory and contractual obligations, we work in partnership with landowners and state and federal regulators to restore land in a manner that is responsive to the specific inter.ests of the local communities. Sagebrush Reseeding to Accelerate Reclamation In Wyoming, EOG has collaborated with local stakeholders to reclaim land previously used as water reser.voirs for drilling and production activities. Reclamation projects have involved EOG working with Wyoming regulators and University of Wyoming students to plant sagebrush seedlings to reestablish vegetation and accelerate the restoration of native grasslands and scrublands. Based on the growth rates of these sage.brush seedlings, we are identifying future planning sites and evaluating how to enhance planting practices. Sunset Reef Campsite In 2019, EOG began working with the BLM to restore land from a reclaimed well site in New Mexico for use as a public campsite. Due to the areaÕs flat topography and easy road access to both Carlsbad Caverns National Park and Guadalupe Mountains National Park, the former well site accommodates campers interested in visiting either of these two parks. EOG partnered with the BLM to convert the land into a campsite, and also provided funding to purchase picnic tables, fire rings, sun shelters and solar-powered lights to be used by campers. The campsite opened in September 2020. Restoring Native Texas Grasslands Since 2015, EOG has supported Texan by Nature, a collaborative partnership between natural resource users and conservation experts to promote conservation efforts to sustain TexasÕs working lands, water supplies and wildlife. In the Eagle Ford, EOG is working in partnership with Texan by Nature and private landowners to create over 350 acres of native pollinator habitat by reseeding well pads and pipeline rights-of-way with native grasses and nectar-producing plants. These grasses and plants can provide high-protein forage and food plots, which maintain and improve habitat conditions for the Monarch butterfly and numerous other species in this migratory corridor. Additionally, the native grasses are lower maintenance and more drought-tolerant than non-native grasses. SOCIAL Stakeholder Engagement Approach OUR Our typical approach includes: COMMUNITIES ¥ Preparation Identifying local stakeholders and potential community interests Understanding community needs and ¥ Outreach responding to concerns is key to cre-Establishing relationships and lines of communication with ating shared value in the communities local stakeholders, including through individual or larger where we live and work.

In addition, we have donated equipment to, and funded equipment and training for, local fire and police departments. In response to the sudden needs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we donated more than 3,400 masks, as well as shoe coverings, hand sanitizer and safety glasses to health care workers across our operating areas. COMMUNITY INVESTMENT EOG employees take pride in their communities and EOG encourages and supports investing in and giving back to those communities in a variety of ways, including financial and in-kind giving and volunteerism. Charitable Donations and Community Giving In 2020, EOG, its U.S. employees and its directors contributed $4.7 million to support charitable and community needs. This amount included $1.7 mil.lion in matching gift donations by EOG. Our community giving and volunteer philosophy reflects our decentralized structure. Our operating area offices and employees are empowered to focus on issues and causes that are relevant to their local communities. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in demand for food banks. In response, EOG and its employees donated to more than 40 different food banks across our U.S. operating areas, raising a total of approximately $780,000 in the U.S. In addition, we donated over 2,000 meals to homeless families through the Star of Hope Mission as part of our Houston United Way campaign. We also donated more than 3,400 masks, other personal protective equipment and meals to health care workers across our operating areas, and contributed financially to a local brewery to make hand sanitizer for first responders in North Dakota. Our ability to respond to immediate needs across our operating areas at a local level reflects not only the strength of our decentralized culture, but also the collective spirit of giving at EOG. 40 FOOD BANKS +As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, EOG and its employees donated to more than 40 different food banks across our U.S. operating areas, raising a total of approximately $780,000 in the U.S. in connection with a $2-for-$1 company-matching program. Health Community & Wellness STEM Education Vitality & Quality of Life & Job Training ¥ Sponsoring a Bike MS team for the 20th consecutive year and raising over $165,000 in 2020. ¥ Providing financial support to the Carl McCain Memorial Foundation to help individuals and families who have worked in the energy industry cover expenses when they are finan.cially burdened by medical expenses. ¥ Supporting organizations such as the Texas ChildrenÕs Hospital, Texas ChildrenÕs Hospital Cancer Center and Snow Drop Foundation, St. Jude ChildrenÕs Research Hospital, Pink the Basin to increase access for mammograms in the Permian Basin region, and Hunt for the Cure to provide children with cancer opportu.nities for outdoor experiences. ¥ Sponsoring students from Cristo Rey Jesuit college preparatory school in Houston through a unique corporate work-study program, which allows students of limited economic resources to gain work experience and earn up to 50 percent of the cost of their annual tuition.

Employees in every location generously donate their time to a wide range of charitable and community organizations and causes that benefit local communities. Volunteerism The spirit of giving is matched by a tradition of participation at EOG. Employees in every location generously donate their time to a wide range of charitable and community organiza.tions and causes that benefit local communities. To encourage volunteer.ism, EOG provides eight hours of paid volunteer time per year to employees. Despite an unprecedented year, EOG employees still found time to safely donate their time and effort to organi.zations, including packing and distrib.uting food, home restoration for those in need, trash collection and cleanup of parks and river ways, and participating in Habitat for Humanity projects. Despite the pandemic forcing many in-person community engagement events to be cancelled or scaled back, EOG employees still responded strongly to many of our annual initiatives. For example, our employees committed the highest amount to our campaign for United Way San Antonio since 2017 and the highest amount for our cam.paign for United Way of Houston since 2016, both of which were matched by EOG. Matching Gifts Program EOG has one of the largest matching gifts programs in the industry. In 2020, employee and director contributions to qualified charitable organizations were matched dollar-for-dollar, up to $75,000 per employee and director. To encourage more giving during a year of great need, EOG instituted a $2-for-$1 match program for donations to food banks from March through June 2020. EOG also matches any contributions made under our annual United Way campaign, which do not count against the matching gifts pro.gram limit. Permian Strategic Partnership Our approach to human rights is informed by the following international EOG is a founding member of the standards and frameworks: Permian Strategic Partnership (PSP). The PSP, which was formed by oil ¥ United Nations Guiding Principles ¥ A partnership with the National and gas companies operating in the on Business and Human Rights Board for Professional Teaching Permian Basin region, collaborates ¥ Universal Declaration of Standards that will allow more with citizens, community organiza-Human Rightsthan 700 area teachers to get tions, private foundations, civic leaders board-certified. ¥ International Labor OrganizationÕs and government officials to develop Declaration on Fundamental ¥ The creation of a rural grant-writing solutions to strengthen local com-Principles and Rights at Work, program to help local communities munities in West Texas and South-including those regarding freedom apply for state, federal and private east New Mexico.

Our People At MPC, we believe our employees are our greatest source of strength, and our culture reflects the quality of individuals across our workforce. Our collaborative efforts to foster an inclusive environment, provide broad-based development and mentorship opportunities, recognize and reward accomplishments, and offer benefits that support the well-being of our employees and their families contribute to increased engagement and fulfilling careers. Empowering our people and prioritizing accountability also are key components for developing MPC’s high-performing culture, which is critical to achieving our strategic vision. Our Core Values Our success is predicated on fostering a working environment where our actions reflect our belief system and support MPC’s responsibilities to all stakeholders, including our people. In October 2018, MPC and Andeavor came together in a strategic combination that made MPC a coast-to-coast refining, marketing and logistics company. In 2019, we established a new set of core values to articulate our collective beliefs, guide our behaviors, and provide a framework for how we treat each other and how we conduct business as a newly integrated unified company. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Human Rights MPC and MPLX have a long-standing commitment to human rights, and in 2020 we adopted a new Human Rights Policy to complement the responsibilities set forth in our Code of Business Conduct. Our policy describes our obligation to respect the rights of our employees and members of the communities where we operate, and provides guidance on managing this important obligation, including conducting due diligence and remediating human rights impacts. We apply the same expectations to our suppliers, contractors and other business partners. We support the goals and principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our commitment extends to the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, including indigenous people, regardless of race, color, gender, gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation or income level. Our Human Rights Policy also expressly states our support for the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, a collaborative multistakeholder initiative guiding companies on providing security for their operations while respecting human rights. Accordingly, we regularly perform risk assessments to continually improve our security processes and evaluate our relationships with public and private security providers. In addition, our employees or contractors who oversee the security of our assets receive training to ensure conduct is consistent with the Voluntary Principles and the protection of human rights. Diversity and Inclusion Our company-wide Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) program is managed by a dedicated D&I Office team and supported by leadership. Our program is based on our three-pillar D&I strategy. The strategy focuses on understanding the benefits of diverse perspectives, increasing diversity across the organization and recognizing that cultural inclusion is an ongoing process. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA – AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Employee Networks Groups In June 2019, we launched our Employee Networks across the organization. These networks focus on six populations: Asian, Black, Hispanic, Veterans, Women and LGBTQ+. All networks encourage ally membership. Over their first six months, our Employee Networks quickly expanded to 54 total network chapters across 79% of our locations, with over 1,900 employees participating. This broad support extends also to our leaders throughout MPC, with each Employee Network represented by two active executive sponsors. The sponsors form several counsels that meet regularly to share updates, gain alignment, build deeper connections across networks and pursue collaboration ideas. Our Employee Networks not only provide opportunities for our employees to make meaningful and supportive connections, but they also serve a significant role in our D&I strategy. “The MPC Black Employee Network is helping the company recruit, retain and advance minority representation in our workforce and leadership team. This will allow the company to benefit from the talent across a diverse set of employees.” Pamela K.M.

We also recognize that each community in which our refineries operate is unique. Accordingly, our stakeholder engagement plans are a collaborative effort between corporate and facility leadership to develop and document a differentiated plan for each facility or geographic area. These plans contain the objectives, strategies and tactics that can guide effective engagement with stakeholders, including: • Community leaders and neighbors • Select advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations and media • State and local government and regulatory officials and their staffs • Major customers and business partners • Employees and retirees While there are some elements consistent across all plans, each facility identifies strategies to engage key stakeholders and audiences that are unique to their circumstances. A majority of our refineries convene Community Advisory Panels (CAPs), which include representatives from various stakeholder groups and MPC employees. These CAPs meet on a regular basis and provide an opportunity for refinery leadership to update the community on key projects and share the facility’s safety and environmental performance. We also solicit feedback from the community at our CAP meetings, giving us to critical insight into our role in the community and allowing us to modify our operations, if needed. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA – AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA MPC Employee Giving and Volunteer Program We understand that part of being a trusted company means being there when people need you the most, side by side, doing the hard work. MPC Gives is an employee-directed, open giving program that we rolled out companywide in the fall of 2019. Via this program employees are provided the opportunity to support organizations and community efforts important to them, and the company supports the efforts by matching employee donations and funding volunteer incentive awards. Last year our employees donated $5.6 million through MPC Gives, as well as through our legacy employee giving and volunteering programs, and contributed more than 55,500 personal hours to strengthen our COMMUNITY INVESTMENT AT A GLANCE communities and help make people’s lives better locally and across the nation.

We strive to ensure everyone returns safely home to their family and friends every day. We do this through our safety systems design, our well-maintained equipment and by learning from our incidents. Part of our effort to promote safety includes a management system based on the principles of RC14001®, the Plan-Do-Check-Act continual improvement cycle, and our OEMS. Together, these components of our safety management system provide us with a comprehensive approach to managing risks and preventing incidents, illnesses and fatalities. Workforce Safety We continually evaluate our processes to further reduce the risk of incident and injury. Our employees, contractors and subcontractors are held to the same standards and expectations for health and safety and are empowered to stop any work where they feel at risk. Programs like Behavior Based Safety allow active engagement where employees can openly discuss alternatives that lead to safer decisions.

Each of our operating locations have emergency response teams and site-specific emergency preparedness and response plans tailored to the risks they may encounter. These location-specific plans are subject to regular drills and exercises to ensure proper implementation in the event of a real incident. Corporate Emergency Response Team (CERT) CERT is a highly trained group of approximately 250 MPC professionals across the corporation with nationally recognized response expertise. CERT members are trained in National Incident Management System Incident Command Structure (NIMS ICS). Members participate in training and drills annually either within their business unit or in a formal CERT exercise. Training and drills are coordinated with governmental agencies and other interested stakeholders. Tiered CERT Response MPC and MPLX operate a tiered response system that allows the response to be directed at the appropriate level within the organization and with flexibility to adjust the response team size commensurate with the needs of the response. • Tier 1 incidents are typically small in size and directed by a local response level team. • Tier 2 incidents are medium in size and directed by a district/regional response level team. • Tier 3 incidents are larger in size or complexity and directed by the Corporate Emergency Response Team (CERT). AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Health and Wellness The health and well-being of our employees is of paramount importance, and we strive to support our employees on their journey to better health. Our Corporate Health Services team operates 21 clinics across our locations with over 75 medical professionals providing on-site access to health services. We also provide a Nurseline that is available 24 hours a day through our online platforms. We offer on-site amenities, such as fitness and wellness resources, and provide virtual and on-site educational sessions delivered by a team of dedicated health and wellness professionals. Our wellness champions, a combination of clinicians and health-passionate employee volunteers, add an additional grassroots support element. Our programs place significant emphasis on preventive health. For example, our Well AllWays incentive program, which is open to all MPC employees, offers a cash stipend for completion of an online health assessment and annual preventive physical. This program encourages employees to take charge of their health, develop relationships with their primary care physicians, and catch potential problems in early stages to allow for more successful treatment options. The stipend amounts increase with spouse participation. We actively promoted this wellness incentive program and saw a significant participation increase in 2019, with over 12,000 employees getting a preventive physical and approximately 9,000 participants completing the online health assessment. We also offer a wide variety of wellness activities, such as health fairs and expos to showcase local organizations in the areas where we operate, corporate-wide challenges, and coordination of teams for company-sponsored health and wellness community activities, including the American Heart Association Heart Walk and Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Our annual My Fuel contest is another popular initiative through which employees submit photos of themselves participating in their favorite healthy activity. We recently developed our Let’s Talk mental health awareness strategy, which launched in 2019. This comprehensive initiative focuses on decreasing the stigma associated with mental health, generating awareness of common mental health illnesses and presenting available resources.

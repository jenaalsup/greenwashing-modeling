Ushered by the completion of the Maxeon spin-off in August 2020 and our new CEO, Peter Faricy, joining the company in April 2021, we established our new customer-focused strategy of creating a lifetime relationship with SunPower by moving well beyond the initial system sale to a full ecosystem of integrated products and services. In further alignment with our residential-only focus, we also announced our exit from the Commercial & Industrial Solutions (CIS) and the Light Commercial (CVAR) businesses, to be completed in 2022.Our cumulative residential installed base of 3.61 gigawatts (GW) in 2021 was an 18% increase from 
3.07 GW in 2020. Our acquisition of Blue Raven Solar expanded our geographic coverage to an additional 
14 states and, all combined, we added a record of nearly 76,0001 customers and also added about 200 new dealers into our sales network. We saw continued improvement in total gross margin, including legacy and CIS, at 17% in 2021, from 16% in 2020, with gross margin for our residential business above 24%. Adjusted Residential EBITDA per customer2 also increased to $2,600 in 2021, a 24% increase from $2,100 in 2020. 
Our balance sheet remains de-levered, with net recourse debt remaining below $300M.We exited 2021 with great top-of-funnel lead generation in our residential business, a record pipeline of 66,000 customers in our new homes segment and a bookings run-rate greater than $130M for SunVault™ storage systems. Looking forward, we are targeting 2x residential solar market growth through 2025 and $3,000 to $4,000 adjusted Residential EBITDA per customer2, enabled by a growing set of high-value, high-performance and affordable panels, new storage offerings and increasingly accessible customer financing options. Our virtual power plant offerings and our partnerships with WallBox and OhmConnect further extend the customer value proposition. Continuing platform investment in product and digital innovation will support our dealers, grow sales, improve our financial products and will add customer control and monitoring of systems for optimum efficiency.With a Total Adjustable Market3 of 100 million U.S. homeowners that could save money with solar by 2026, 
a tight residential customer-focused strategy and a growing geographic footprint, we are excited  to lean into the opportunities in front of us.  Cumulative Residential Installed Base(Gigawatts)3.613.072.68201920202021Total Residential Customers(Thousands)427351307* Financial numbers are reflected on a Non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.

SunPower is committed to investing in proactive federal, state and local public policy advocacy that enables access to the electricity bill savings and resilience of distributed solar and battery storage for all Americans, particularly those in historically disadvantaged communities, while making a difference in tackling climate change. In addition, our advocacy efforts help ensure greater market stability and risk mitigation for our business and employees. SunPower is proud to work with like-minded national trade associations and non-profit organizations including the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Advanced Energy Economy (AEE), Local Solar For All, Clean Energy for America, American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) and the Smart Electric Power Association (SEPA). We also work with more than a dozen state trade associations and partner with grassroots advocacy organizations including Vote Solar, Solar United Neighbors, the Solar Access Coalition, the Solar Rights Alliance; dozens of environmental, consumer and justice organizations at the state and national level; and other research, academic and policy institutions to promote favorable public policies.   In 2021, this collective advocacy has been focused on expanding access to the benefits of distributed energy by maintaining critical state policies like net energy metering and favorable rate design, expanding state and federal incentives, broadening building codes requiring solar and storage for new homes, promoting favorable international trade policy and deploying SolarAPP+, an online instant permitting tool. Our successes in 2021 at the state and local level included defeating multiple proposals to dramatically and negatively change California’s net energy metering program; expanding solar and storage incentive programs in several states including Illinois, Connecticut, 
New Jersey and Massachusetts; expanding storage building code requirements for new homes in 
California; and the adoption of SolarAPP+ by local jurisdictions. At the federal level, we made substantial progress toward legislation to establish 
a long-term extension of the federal solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and a new standalone battery storage ITC. Finally, in 2021, we successfully implemented new tools to educate our customers, employees and dealers about critical public policy issues and make it easy for them to directly contact their decision-makers.About—Policy and Market Development13Our GoalsCovering both sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), our targets set clear benchmarks for the future of our company. We recognize the important role that 
we play in the solar industry and in the American economy, and we believe it is our responsibility to use this position to create a more sustainable, equitable and inclusive society. Our Goals14Goals TableTopic Goals Measure Baseline1 2021 Target Year Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions 1 Establish a net zero carbon emissions program for our U.S. downstream freight3 GHG Mt / MWd 28 19 0 2030 2 Convert our U.S. fleet vehicles to Hybrid or Electric Vehicles  % 0% 0% 90% 2030 Carbon Emissions 3 Enable the installation of solar systems to help our customers avoid millions of metric tons of carbon emissions4 Metric Tons (Mt)

the solar industry, by 2025. The consumer benefits of solar energy include lower electricity costs, resilience against power outages and climate change-induced weather events, and independence from traditional fossil fuel energy suppliers. Solar employees benefit from stable, well-paying jobs in a growing industry. These benefits should be available to all Americans regardless of their race, gender or economic background. The 25x25 Initiative specifies the following commitments, which are measured in our annual ESG report:123Increasing workforce diversity40% of our workforce represented by women; 25% of our workforce represented by Black and Hispanic/Latinx peopleEmphasis will be placed on workforce development programs for the company’s growing residential installation teams 
across the countryExpanding access for customers25% of U.S. residential customers made up of people who live in disadvantaged communitiesIncludes the development of a new program 
to provide low-income customers with 
no-interest loansEnsuring industry equity25% of the U.S. dealers and subcontractors/suppliers we work with will be owned by women and people of colorIncludes establishment of a new dealer diversity program and creation of 
new partnerships with minority-owned business organizationsOur Goals—SunPower’s 25x25 Pledge16Decarbonizing Our 
U.S. Freight and FleetWhile our products and services make a tangible difference in the fight against climate change, we recognize the carbon emissions created in our company’s regular operations. SunPower has established specific goals to reduce carbon emissions from our U.S. downstream freight and fleet vehicles to maximize the positive impact our company has on the environment. We will work to reduce carbon emissions for our U.S. downstream freight by establishing programs to achieve net zero by 2030. Additionally, we plan to convert at least 90% of our U.S. fleet vehicles to hybrid or electric vehicles by 2030.Our Goals—Decarbonizing Our U.S. Freight and Fleet

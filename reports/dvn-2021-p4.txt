Progressive principles and practices guide our board of directors, executive management and workforce  in delivering results with integrity and courage. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines support the board and management in enhancing stockholder value, consistent with the long-term interests of the company and our stakeholders. The guidelines cover board composition, policies, procedures and committees, and provide direction for the recruitment, selection, responsibilities, compensation and evaluation of individual directors. We revised our Corporate Governance Guidelines in March 2021 to reflect the evolving needs of our post-merger company. Independent board members bring fresh perspectives and diverse skills to their oversight of the company. The majority of Devon’s board members qualify as independent, based on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. Eight of 11 (73%) Devon board members qualified as independent as of June 2021. The full board has primary responsibility for risk oversight of the company, with standing committees dedicated to specific areas of risk: Audit, Compensation, Reserves and Governance, Environmental, and Public Policy.

One of the outcomes was expanding the role of the Governance Committee by establishing the board Governance, Environmental, and Public Policy Committee  to oversee EHS, public policy, stockholder engagement  and sustainability. The board established the industry’s first fixed-plus-variable dividend strategy and created a board Dividend Committee to assist the board in administering the program, designed to sustainably return meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash to shareholders. After closing the merger with WPX, the board appointed a non-management director to serve in a lead director capacity. Among other responsibilities, the lead director seeks to optimize board performance through regular feedback to help ensure the diverse viewpoints of all directors are heard and that a climate of constructive candor is created in which frank and thoughtful discussion occurs. Independence Eight of Devon’s 11 directors qualify as independent under NYSE standards and SEC regulations. As of June 2021 40 Devon Energy    2021 Sustainability Report    Governance Advancing board diversity Throughout 2020 and 2021, leaders have regularly updated the board on Devon’s post-merger progress related to integrating operations, culture and workforce, as well as addressing the volatility in commodity and financial markets and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our decisions and actions have benefited from informed input from board members with a wide range of experiences, viewpoints and backgrounds. Attracting and sustaining a diverse and inclusive board that can provide thoughtful counsel has long been a priority for Devon. We’ve made progress diversifying the Devon board, including electing two women among the five most recent board additions. As of June 2021, three women and one racially diverse director served on our board, and the Audit and GEPP committees were both chaired by women. Our directors range in age from 44 to 72, all below the maximum age of 74 required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Shareholders elect Devon directors at the annual meeting for one-year terms. Our bylaws require a director who does not receive a plurality of votes in an uncontested election to offer to resign. This has not happened in the company’s 50-year history; our directors received an average approval rating of 96% at our 2021 annual meeting. To align the board’s and stockholders’ interests with our long-term performance, independent directors are expected to have a significant ownership stake in Devon. The board determines the compensation of non-management directors annually based on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee. Compensation for our non-management directors, which has remained relatively consistent in recent years, is based on market norms and includes a combination of cash retainers and equity awards. Devon executives receive no additional compensation for serving on our board. The GEPP Committee nominates qualified candidates to be Devon directors, seeking factors such as the nominees’ integrity and accountability, ability to provide informed judgment, respect from peers and high performance standards. Tenure Diversity The tenure of our directors reflects a balance  We approached our directors to voluntarily  of experience and fresh perspectives. self-disclose their race, ethnicity and gender.

The leadership team updates the board regularly on our economic and operational risks and opportunities and on our ESG performance. In 2020, the Compensation Committee considered Devon’s performance relative to our corporate goals, including our Total Stockholder Return (TSR) compared to our peers and executives’ individual and business unit or organizational performance. In addition, we set challenging corporate goals for financial results, expenditures, oil and gas production, overall value of our risked resource portfolio, ESG/EHS performance, stakeholder alignment and our COVID-19 response. Devon met or exceeded our 2020 corporate goals other than our EHS target rate for recordable serious incidents and fatalities (SIF), which is a component of our EHS goal. Notwithstanding this high performance, the Compensation Committee chose to acknowledge the challenging industry and broader market conditions by reducing the performance bonus from 153% of target to 75% of target. In addition, approximately 89% of the value of total direct compensation awarded to the CEO, and an average of approximately 82% of the value of total direct compensation awarded to the other named executives, was delivered through performance bonuses and LTI. In 2020, 63% of voting stockholders voted “for” our executive compensation, significantly lower than the say-on-pay votes for the previous three years. Devon increased our outreach with our institutional investors to seek feedback on our proxy disclosure and solicit their input on proxy voting items. We responded and took action on their primary critiques and reported on them in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) section of our 2021 proxy statement.  As a result, 94% of voting stockholders voted “for” the say-on-pay vote at the 2021 annual meeting. Additional Skills and Experience Three of our directors have experience with technology or cybersecurity.

At Devon, climate-related issues are managed by formal corporate management structures, including board level oversight, and are integrated into  our enterprise risk management system. For example, active risk management led us in 2019 to set our first methane reduction target (beyond regulatory requirements). Read more about our updated target and other climate tactics in the Environment section and our CDP Climate disclosures. 42 Devon Energy    2021 Sustainability Report    Governance Systematically identifying and managing economic, operational and reputational risks to our business is essential to Devon’s efforts to deliver results safely, ethically and responsibly. The Devon board of directors has primary responsibility for risk oversight, and each director has experience in  risk management. As part of this oversight role, the board helps ensure that our risk management programs are designed and implemented appropriately. Four standing board oversight committees consider the risks inherent in their areas of oversight and update the full board. The Devon management team, in turn, executes the board’s risk management directives. This includes overseeing and reporting on Devon’s day-to-day efforts to manage strategic, financial, operational, market, ESG, EHS and other business risks. The head of our internal audit group reports directly to the board’s Audit Committee, and receives additional guidance from our executive vice president and chief financial officer. The internal audit director is certified in risk management assurance by the Institute of Internal Auditors and leads a team of professionals who hold 20 different certifications in public accounting, internal auditing with a risk management component, fraud examination, cybersecurity and other specializations. Maintaining awareness of business risk An important step in our enterprise risk management process is the annual analysis during which the board, management and subject matter experts across the company consider the likelihood that certain risks could cause economic or reputational damage to Devon. We also consider the level of preparedness for each risk. This analysis helps us determine the material risks to our business. Our process includes exercises and workshops with employees focused on various risk mitigation strategies. Leaders from multiple work disciplines are involved in these workshops to help us identify new and emerging risks and maintain awareness of business risk across the organization.

Insights from our shareholder dialogues shape our ESG programs, focus our disclosures and impact our compensation structure. We’ve learned through ongoing outreach with our shareholders that ESG performance is a key component of their valuation of Devon. As a result, we’ve strengthened governance practices to more effectively manage the risks and opportunities of issues such as climate change. In 2021, we expanded the responsibilities of the former Governance Committee to include environmental and public policy oversight, renaming it the Governance, Environmental, and Public Policy (GEPP) Committee. The GEPP Committee oversees company management in setting strategy, establishing goals and integrating sustainability into our business activities. The committee also reviews Devon’s environmental, health and safety and social responsibility programs. Our senior-level ESG Steering Committee coordinates the related efforts and regularly updates our executive committee, GEPP Committee and the full board on our progress. Building relationships with our shareholders helps Devon anticipate and manage issues that influence our long-term success. Under the direction of Devon’s vice president of corporate governance, secretary and associate general counsel, we communicate directly with shareholders to understand their interests and needs, and to share our strategies and plans. When a far lower percentage of voting stockholders voted “for” our executive compensation (say-on-pay) in 2020 than in the previous three years, we proactively sought feedback from our institutional investors. Devon interacted with approximately 100 representatives of institutions totaling more than 46% of outstanding shares to discuss our 2020 say-on-pay vote. We analyzed the feedback from these discussions and from critiques contained in governance reports received in response to our proxy statement. Our 2021 proxy statement details our resulting actions and responses. We believe this approach contributed to approximately 94% of voting stockholders casting ballots “for” Devon’s say-on-pay vote in 2021. In meetings with shareholders, we often invite Devon senior leaders and subject matter experts to provide information on topics of interest, such as executive compensation and field environmental practices. We share key themes with Devon senior management and our board, who appreciate the shareholder feedback. Our directors also welcome the opportunity to engage with shareholders as appropriate. With our shareholders’ focus on climate change, Devon is committed to reporting our related activities and progress. In December 2021, we published an updated Climate Change Assessment Report to reflect changes in our asset portfolio since publishing the first report in 2018. The 2021 Increasing transparency Devon’s actions to meet our shareholder needs for ESG information include the following: Published Climate Change Assessment Reports in  2018, 2020 and 2021. Set our first methane intensity target in 2019, and achieved it in 2020. Set new environmental performance targets in 2021, including net zero GHG emissions. report enhances the company’s alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), an international, multi-industry-led initiative launched to develop recommendations for voluntary disclosure of climate-related risk. Devon aligns with TCFD because it is the preferred disclosure framework for our investors and other stakeholders. We also continue to set targets to drive improvements in our environmental performance, including our board-approved targets for reducing GHG and methane emissions intensity, flaring and freshwater use set in June 2021. Benchmarking ESG performance We participate in a number of third-party ESG-focused surveys and assessments that help stakeholders benchmark our progress. Sustainalytics, ISS, Vigeo Eiris and CDP have  all ranked our ESG scores in the top tier of our peer groups. These assessments also help us refine our transparency efforts and improve our ESG performance. Devon regularly evaluates surveys and additional public disclosures we could make to target our reporting on the information that is most meaningful for shareholders and other stakeholders. Published a Sustainability Report annually since 2018. Published our Political Activity and Lobbying Report annually since 2018. Incorporated emissions, safety and other ESG metrics into our executive compensation structure. Elevated ESG reporting in investor communications through third-party surveys. Participated in CDP climate reporting for 17 consecutive years and CDP water reporting for eight consecutive years. Governance In 2021, we’re taking this balanced approach on priority issues such as preserving our access to resources on federal lands and addressing potential state and federal legislation for carbon, methane and greenhouse gas emissions. We seek to help stakeholders understand the impacts of proposed policies on our day-to-day operations and longer-term business prospects, as well as the value of oil and gas production to governments and society.

Devon engages on issues as diverse as climate change, emissions reductions, hydraulic fracturing and federal lands access. We’re committed to having constructive conversations, building relationships and developing solutions that help us deliver results while addressing stakeholder concerns. As a leading U.S. energy company, Devon participates in local, state, national and global economies. The company takes public policy positions on issues that impact our business, including regulations, taxes, trade, jobs and ESG performance. We have a responsibility to advocate for laws and rules that meet business and societal needs, and to consider and communicate the impacts and trade-offs of our decisions. At the board level, the Governance, Environmental, and Public Policy (GEPP) Committee reviews our advocacy efforts and assists with evaluating political, legislative and regulatory developments that could affect Devon. Our vice president of public and government affairs, who reports to the executive vice president and general counsel and is a member of the ESG Steering Committee, leads our efforts to advocate for Devon’s business interests. Our core value of integrity commits us to fulfill our advocacy role in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules. Balanced engagement Important decisions about energy, the environment and the economy require accurate information and thoughtful deliberation at all levels of government. To encourage sound public policy, Devon seeks out and welcomes engagements with stakeholders who represent diverse viewpoints. For example, we’ve worked with stakeholders ranging from New Mexico state regulators to environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund on methane regulations and flaring. Our vice president of public and government affairs is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute’s advisory board and engages with the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus and other federal lawmaker groups. In 2021, we’re taking this balanced approach on priority issues such as preserving our access to resources on federal lands and addressing potential state and federal legislation for carbon, methane and greenhouse gas emissions. We seek to help stakeholders understand the impacts of proposed policies on our day-to-day operations and longer-term business prospects, as well as the value of oil and gas production to governments and society. We plan to engage proactively to find sensible public policy solutions. Industry participation To make our views on regulations and laws known, Devon participates in business coalitions, industry associations,  trade groups and advocacy organizations. We share information about industry issues with our employees to aid discussions with their friends and neighbors, and we encourage them to vote. Devon employees are active in industry associations such  as the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA), Texas Oil and Gas Association (TXOGA), the Petroleum Association of Wyoming (PAW), North Dakota Petroleum Council, American Exploration and Production Council (AXPC) and the American Petroleum Institute (API). As an example, a Devon employee is active on API’s Occupational Safety and Health Subcommittee, which proposed a voluntary safety program to elevate the overall safety performance of the onshore exploration and production industry. We’re proud to have a Devon representative sharing our values and contributing to industry best practices on this important industry committee. 2020 Political Activity and Lobbying Report * Political Activity and Lobbying Report Archives * Governance 2019 2018 2017 WorkforceGovernance SafetyOverviewWorkforceWorkforceWorkforceWorkforceWorkforceWorkforcePublic Advocacy continued Increasing disclosures Our public advocacy discussions often include Devon’s environmental, social and governance performance.

The board and its Audit Committee take an active interest in cybersecurity as part of their risk management oversight role and receive regular updates on our information security program and cyberattack trends from the Devon management team. To mitigate cybersecurity risk, we maintain an industry-leading corporate information security policy and program aligned with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework for risk management. Our policy and program are assessed by third-party experts, and we internally exercise and test our incident response and disaster-recovery plans as part of Devon’s corporate emergency preparedness program. A culture of prevention is important to our digital security. Devon provides cybersecurity awareness training for all employees and contractors during onboarding and through annual refresher training. Teams that have access to sensitive data receive specific training and employees who help us avoid cybersecurity events receive recognition. Responsible use of our information systems is covered in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Information General Usage Policy and related policies. As part of its role to protect data and technology appropriately, our digital security team evaluates technologies that Devon builds, buys or deploys and provides recommendations to the business owners. This risk assessment role is essential as Devon increasingly develops our own patented technologies, deploys mobile apps in the field, and partners with other innovators to commercialize and scale technology solutions. Mitigating cybersecurity risk Our corporate information security policy and program is aligned with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework for risk management. 100% of employees working on the Devon security operations team have earned industry certifications in security essentials and incident handling. Our culture of prevention includes training, recognition and enforcement. We experienced no business interruptions or material losses from cyberattacks in 2020 or  to date in 2021. We use best practices in our external- facing website. 100Governance Ethics and compliance helpline metrics secure and confidential report to our third-party Ethics and stringent Code of Ethics holding them to the highest level of ethical and legal behavior. 100100of reports were unsubstantiated, simple inquiries or system tests. of reports were unsubstantiated, simple inquiries or system tests. 98100of reports were unsubstantiated, simple inquiries or system tests. 100100100Ethics and Integrity Responsible business conduct Updated our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and onboarded new employees to our code and related policies post-merger. Established a cross-functional ethics  committee, a legacy WPX best practice, to consider reports of suspected violations of the code, policies,  laws or regulations. Closed 100% of investigations resulting from a report to our Ethics and Compliance Helpline in 2020. Fraud protection Devon’s active fraud awareness program helps us prevent invoicing abuse, digital scams and other types of fraud. Our team of fraud examiners with fraud investigation experience enables us to quickly take action to prevent financial loss and mitigate risk. We continue to expand our internal steering committee that identifies industry trends and emerging threats, most recently by adding operations experts who can help us root out fraud in the field. The committee developed fraud identification training for employees who work in the field, in accounting and other functions. We also share information on fraud trends and threats with all employees to help them recognize and report fraudulent activity. Integrity is the foundational corporate value at Devon. Doing business with openness and honesty is the starting point to live out our other core values of building trusting relationships, having courage to take intelligent risks and delivering results. Devon is committed to high ethical, moral, professional and legal standards in all our business practices and relationships. We seek to always do what’s right, be transparent with our results and speak up with respect. The Audit Committee of Devon’s board of directors monitors our business practices and ethical standards and oversees legal and regulatory compliance. Together with Devon’s executive vice president and general counsel, the Audit Committee annually reviews our business ethics program, including the code and our Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedures. The code guides each Devon director, officer and employee in fulfilling our responsibilities to each other, our business partners, shareholders, government and legal systems. We also require our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer to adhere to an additional, more stringent Code of Ethics holding them to the highest level of ethical and legal behavior. Devon directors, officers and employees also are expected to comply with policies that provide guidance on specific business practices. These include our Zero Tolerance Anti-Harassment Policy, Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure, Conflicts of Interest Policy, Employee Gifts and Entertainment Declaration Policy, Information System General Usage Policy and Environmental, Health, and Safety Policy.  We take proactive steps to reinforce the importance of understanding our ethical standards, legal obligations and regulatory compliance requirements. Devon employees are required to complete an ethics training course when they join the company. Following the merger, employees joining Devon from WPX received this ethics training as part of their onboarding. Annually, all employees receive the same ethics training and are required to acknowledge and agree to abide by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We review the training, code and policies each year and update them as needed to keep the content current and relevant. Our goal is to maintain high awareness and understanding of Devon’s expectations. Obligations for reporting Violations of the code or related policies are serious matters that could damage Devon’s relationships and reputation. Devon employees are obligated to enforce the code and report potential violations, with no fear of retaliation. Reports can be made by contacting our executive vice president and general counsel. Employees and other stakeholders may also make a safe, secure and confidential report to our third-party Ethics and Compliance Helpline by phone or online. The Helpline is available at all times to report harassment, inappropriate behavior, fraud, unsafe acts, accounting irregularities, human rights violations or any other potential code or policy violation. The Helpline can also be used to seek guidance on Devon’s ethics policy, follow up on a reported issue or ask an ethics-related question. Our board of directors receives periodic reports on Helpline activity to assist in its role of monitoring our ethical standards and practices. Ethics and compliance helpline metrics 98% of reports were unsubstantiated, simple inquiries or system tests. 100% of investigations intiated in 2020 were closed by year-end. 45% of users requested anonymity. 69% of reports of possible ethics violations came through the online portal. yGovernance emergencdepartmentsThe merger of Devon and WPX gives us an opportunity to yyemergencemergencanyemergencyyyEmergency Preparedness Ready to respond Solidifying our One Team capabilities for emergency preparedness, response and recovery as part of post-merger integration activities. Conducted a successful virtual tabletop exercise that also enabled us to add virtual communications to our incident command toolkit. Participated in establishing Oklahoma’s energy assurance plan to assist the state during an energy emergency. Activated our incident command system before the COVID-19 pandemic was widely recognized in the U.S., allowing Devon to take early actions for employee health and safety and business continuity. Being proactive and prepared is part of Devon’s culture. Our centralized, coordinated approach to emergency preparedness prioritizes life safety and business continuity for incidents that could affect our employees, our assets, our business and the environment. Devon’s corporate emergency management function leads our emergency response and recovery efforts for weather events, operational incidents, supply disruptions and other incidents. To manage emergency response in cooperation with community agencies, we follow the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) National Incident Management System (NIMS). We provide in-house training, drills and exercises on the NIMS Incident Command System (ICS) to promote timely, effective incident response. The head of our emergency management program is a certified Emergency Manager and ICS instructor, which strengthens our capabilities. In addition, about 150 employees are trained as floor wardens to lead occupants of buildings and facilities to safety and provide medical assistance during an emergency. Due to the pandemic, in-person exercises were replaced with virtual tabletop exercises for the aviation incident management team and Wyoming work group in 2020. Based on how quickly our teams adapted, we believe virtual communications can support our ability to manage events  in the future. Complementary competencies The merger of Devon and WPX gives us an opportunity to look at emergency preparedness from different perspectives and share best practices. In assessing the legacy systems, we quickly identified complementary competencies: WPX’s strong capabilities in the first hour of response and Devon’s centralized, coordinated emergency management program. We continue to assess both systems, existing plans, our asset portfolio, our personnel and potential threats and hazards. We’re creating a consistent foundation across all locations with basic incident management training and then validating it in a discussion-based exercise, followed by operational drills and full-scale exercises at a later date. Community partners To help ensure preparedness, Devon engages law enforcement, fire departments, emergency management and emergency medical services. We follow the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program, which allows us to provide community partners with documentation that validates their participation for federal funding and medical facility accreditation requirements. In addition to maintaining proficiency in our operating areas, Devon advocates for strong emergency management capabilities throughout industry and government. In 2020, the head of our emergency management program served as the chair of the Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Coordinating Council that works closely with the U.S. Departments of Energy and Homeland Security on physical and cybersecurity preparedness. Through our involvement in the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), Devon was invited to participate in establishing Oklahoma’s energy assurance plan to assist the state with physical and cybersecurity during an energy emergency. We’re proud to help our home state in this public-private partnership. Protecting our license to operate Devon documents areas for improvement, best practices and strengths after every exercise and actual response. Corrective actions are incorporated into our EHS incident management system. When emergencies and incidents occur, our continuous improvement efforts and training enable us to protect our workforce, our neighbors and our assets. In turn, we’re protecting our business and license to operate.

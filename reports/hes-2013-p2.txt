This past year was one of the most challenging in our company’s history. It was a time of significant change as we began the final phase of a transformation that will turn Hess into a focused, pure play oil and gas exploration and production company. As we complete our transition in 2014 and 2015, we will have a renewed focus on our key workforce programs, including talent management, learning and development, and diversity and inclusion development. We will stay focused on continuing to create a work environment that fosters innovation, professional growth and teamwork so we can achieve our goals. Leveraging the skills and experience of our workforce is critical to achieving success. total number of Employees: 12,128 learning and development Hess offers leadership development through a suite of three leadership programs. Each is tailored to meet the competency development needs of different levels of leadership within the organization, from early-career supervisors through senior leadership. In 2013 throughout the year we conducted targeted programs in supervisory management and mid-level leadership in the United States and Malaysia. Participating supervisors and managers collectively logged 3,400 hours of training. Training offerings in leadership and many other topics are available to all employees through our Learning Center, which provides access to more than 1,000 courses (virtual and instructor led) on many topics, ranging from technical to soft skills. In 2013 employees logged over 70,000 training hours across more than 400 unique courses. new hires and early Career programs One of the issues affecting the U.S. oil and gas industry is an aging workforce. Hess has developed and implemented programs to speed up the integration of new employees and the development of early career technical hires as skilled older workers choose to retire. Employees new to Hess benefit from our onboarding and orientation process, known as Passport to Hess. The Passport to Hess intranet site provides information about the company and Hess Values, as well as links to the Learning Center and the Resource Center. The Learning and Resource Centers are critical portals for managing one’s career development path. The onboarding program for new hires also establishes a system for supervisors and new employees to work closely together for the first 90 days at Hess and to make sure the integration process goes as smoothly as possible. New Hess employees may also be eligible to join the supplemental early career development programs we offer. Our Global Professional Development Program, first piloted in 2011, was modified during 2013 to focus on supplementing and enriching the skills and knowledge of newly hired technical personnel participating in the Hess Global Foundation Program. This program is Immediately following the company’s March 2013 announcement of the changes to the Hess portfolio, we worked on transition plans to provide our employees with information about how the reorganization would impact each individual. For several months, team members did not know what positions would continue in the new structure. We recognize that this created uncertainty, but it was important to allow time to complete a thoughtful, thorough staffing process at all levels of our organization. Employees whose jobs were ultimately slated for elimination were provided enhanced severance packages and financial counseling. In addition, career counseling was offered to assist these employees with external job searches.  In 2013 the majority of employees who were part of U.S. businesses that were sold were offered jobs at their new employers with no disruption in pay or benefits; these employees also received lump sum severance packages. Employees in our London office, which we closed in the last quarter of 2013, were offered enhanced severance and provided with financial counseling, as well as career counseling to assist them with external job searches. Employees were encouraged to apply for open positions within Hess in other locations. We also reached out to oil and gas companies to make them aware that employees were leaving. To keep employees informed, we sent out regular updates by email, conducted multiple “town hall” style meetings, and hosted monthly “breakfasts with leaders” where employees could ask questions and get additional details about the transition. Our goal was to provide a constant flow of information to keep our people as up to date as possible. We also established a company intranet site where employees could find details about severance packages, retirement, medical and other employee benefit plans, staffing reorganizations and other key issues. The site included a question and answer section where we addressed the most common queries about the reductions and the changes in operations. designed to fully prepare our engineers and geoscientists for challenging assignments early in their careers and to help them keep pace with the rapid evolution of their chosen disciplines through training, mentorship and on-the.job assignments. diversitY and inClusion Hess is committed to diversity and equal employment opportunities for all employees and job candidates regardless of race, color, gender, age, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, disability or veteran status.

They postulate that investors believe that all coal, gas and oil reserves will be produced and that investors are not fully versed regarding climate risks, presumably because companies have not quantified them fully. Furthermore, they suggest that once investors understand the potential consequences of climate policies, they will be less inclined to invest in hydrocarbon producers. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that the world will need to keep to a trillion tonne budget of carbon emissions, from the beginning of the industrial era to the year 2100, to maintain a greater than 66 percent chance of limiting the maximum global atmospheric temperature rise to two degrees Centigrade (2°C). This assumes that governments unite to enact climate policies by 2020 in line with the 2°C goal, and means that approximately half of discovered oil, coal and gas resources will remain unburned. A review of the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook indicates that the world will require approximately 35 percent more energy in 2035 than it did in 2010 to meet growing demand.† In this scenario, energy efficiency will keep growth in energy demand in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries stable, while growth in energy demand in non-OECD countries will continue to expand rapidly.† Meeting the growing demand for energy will require the use of all forms of energy, including traditional fossil fuels, all forms of renewables and commercial-scale carbon neutral technologies. Even with rapid growth in renewables, the IEA forecasts that fossil fuels will still comprise at least  60 percent of the world energy mix in 2040 compared to 70 percent today. The carbon bubble concept assumes that coal, oil and gas are equally vulnerable to climate policies restricting fossil fuels without considering the differences in carbon intensity. Coal is the most carbon intensive fossil fuel, with a significantly larger CO2 footprint than traditional forms of natural gas and oil, making coal more at risk than other fossil fuels. For example, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency’s Annual Energy Outlook 2014, the combination of slow growth in domestic electricity demand, competitively priced natural gas, programs encouraging renewable fuel use, and the implementation of environmental rules dampens future coal use. Hess’ reserves are mostly light crude oil and natural gas and thus less likely to be significantly impacted by initial carbon regulations. A global policy that results in a low carbon scenario where emissions are held to a 2°C change is most likely to harm less developed countries where the need for affordable, reliable and accessible energy is most urgent. While such a policy is possible, Hess believes that governments will choose a more moderate path that allows for economic growth while mitigating the effects of GHG emissions through a combination of policy related programs and efforts at adaptation. As a result, we believe that markets are pricing carbon intensive assets rationally. They are determining the value of firms mostly based on their expectations of future profitability, not just on the size of their mineral reserves. The risks associated with climate change have been disclosed in annual reports and discussed with investors for many years. †Source: Exploring the concept of “unburnable carbon,” IPIECA Fact Sheet, June 2014. 1.437 Million barrels of oil Equivalent (boE) Conventional  Unconventional Deepwater Acid Gas * Deepwater and acid gas are conventional resources but they are shown separately  here to provide more clarity on our reserve base.

A more in-depth discussion of our enterprise risk model can be found on page 12 of this report. Steps are then taken to mitigate risks that we consider likely to impact new projects and existing operations. We also participate in industry initiatives and working groups that focus on quantifying and disclosing emissions performance and climate change related risks and opportunities. For example, we chair the IPIECA Climate Reporting Task Force. CliMate Change governanCe struCture The Hess Leadership Team, composed of senior executive officers, holds the highest direct responsibility for climate change in our company.

We have reported emissions from customer and consumer use of sold products since 2008; these comprise the majority of our Scope 3 emissions. Our methodology for calculating product use emissions addresses the products that we refine and sell, as well as the natural gas that we produce and sell for third party consumption. We have closed our refineries and, as a result, product emissions have dropped from 47 million tonnes in 2008 to 14 million tonnes in 2013. These emissions result primarily from the natural gas that we sell for third party consumption. In addition to our product use emissions, we began identifying and quantifying potential carbon hotspots in our value chain in 2009, and since then have collected data associated with third party supply and distribution and business travel. We refined our approach in 2012 to focus on third party activities where we were able to obtain accurate and reliable source data. Million tonnes co2e 100% 90% Use of Sold Products                    13.9 80% Purchased Goods 10.4 70% and Services     Other*               0.8 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% * Includes the following Scope 3 categories as set forth in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard: Capital goods, Fuel-and-energy-related activities, Upstream transportation and distribution, Waste generated in operations, Business travel and Processing of sold products. In 2013 we expanded our Scope 3 emissions identification and reporting, in part to evaluate the materiality and relevance of each of the 15 categories included in the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard. We joined the CDP Supplier Initiative to improve our understanding of third party GHG emissions associated with purchased goods and services, and disclosed information on all Scope 3 categories in our CDP Investor disclosure. See our CDP Investor disclosure at www.hess.com/ docs/CDPresponse. We also joined IPIECA’s Scope 3 Reporting Task Force, which is in the process of developing an oil and gas sector Scope 3 standard. As Hess completes its transformation to a pure play E&P company, and as oil and gas sector methodology develops that ensures more consistency and comparability, we plan to reassess our Scope 3 emissions inventory and mater Scope 3 categories for future reporting. We have purchased carbon credits ial annually since 2010 to offset 100 percent or more of business travel emissions. For the past two years we have purchased these credits from The Climate Trust (TCT). In addition, we provided a $25,000 grant to TCT to support an avoided grasslands conversion carbon offsets project in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota. The grant advanced validation of a new carbon offset protocol for avoided grasslands conversion by the American Carbon Registry. The methodology enables grassland producers to earn income from preserving grasslands and the soil carbon present in these systems. As a result, this project will support ranching families and rural communities in a region of noted rural population loss while preserving sensitive habitat. eMissions reduCtion initiatives We track year-on-year changes in air emissions from each of our assets, with special attention to those that are significant contributors to total corporate GHG emissions. We then focus on those contributors where GHG reductions are technically and economically feasible within their operating rhythm, such as North Dakota. In 2013 our North Dakota asset continued to make progress with flaring reduction and natural gas capture initiatives and piloted a water-by-pipeline initiative that will reduce truck transportation. flaring Prior to the development of the Bakken formation in North Dakota, Hess had one of the lowest flaring rates in North Dakota for the industry for conventional wells, at below 5 percent. This low flaring rate was achieved by consistently expanding the infrastructure necessary to gather and commercialize natural gas associated with oil production. Several years ago, our expansion in the Bakken formation by acquisitions included acreage in remote areas of the Bakken play, where gas gathering infrastructure was not built. This resulted in a significant increase in our flaring rates in North Dakota. Our challenge has been and continues to be having the necessary infrastructure in place to monetize the associated gas production and minimize flaring. We are meeting this challenge by investing more than $1.5 billion to capture and monetize natural gas from our shale energy wells by building gas gathering systems and expanding our Tioga Gas Processing Plant. We have set a target to reduce our flaring rate at the wellhead in North Dakota to 10 percent no later than 2017, and possibly sooner depending on the timely completion of these infrastructure projects, many of which are subject to obtaining permits and rights of way. In the first quarter of 2014 we completed the Tioga Gas Processing Plant expansion. This more than doubles the plant’s capacity from 100 million to 250 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/d) and increases the liquids processing capacity almost tenfold, from 260,000 to 2.5 million gallons per day. The expanded capacity will contribute to a reduction in flaring from production operations in the region. In addition, 10 gas gathering projects are planned to  Hess Industry 35% 30% 25% 20% 15% 10% Hess 2017 Target 5% 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2017 Flaring rates for conventional and unconventional wells. Source:  North Dakota Industrial Commission, Department of Mineral Resources Oil and Gas Division.

These projects include new and expanded gas gathering lines and compression stations. natural gas Capture In addition to addressing our long term flaring challenge by increasing gas processing capacity at Tioga and expanding gas gathering lines and compression stations, in the nearer term we are also mitigating flaring by exploring ways to capture gas at the wellhead for use in our drilling operations and for conversion to Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). There has been much debate in recent years about the climate implications of increased natural gas usage. Although natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, methane escaping during the production, delivery and use of natural gas has the potential to reduce some of the benefits. Methane emissions come from a range of sources and sectors of the economy, which are unevenly dispersed across the landscape. These characteristics complicate measurement and attribution and lead to significant uncertainties in estimates of current and projected methane emissions. Better data collection and measurement will improve our understanding of methane sources and trends, and enable more effective management of opportunities to reduce methane emissions. Hess, together with a number of other companies, is collaborating with Colorado State University and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) on a study that aims to quantify national methane emissions associated with the natural gas industry’s gathering infrastructure and processing plants. Researchers are working with six companies and using tracer gas releases to quantify methane emissions from these activities. This study in turn is part of a much broader collaborative effort spearheaded by EDF that involves partnerships with approximately 100 universities, research institutions and companies. It is divided into 16 distinct projects that will estimate methane emissions in given areas or from specific pieces of equipment. A range of sophisticated scientific techniques are being deployed across all projects. In many cases, the measurement techniques are paired to provide greater insight and certainty. The goal is to have all project results submitted for publication in peer reviewed scientific journals during 2014. It is hoped that these projects will inform the ongoing debate and, where necessary, refocus emission reduction strategies. We have been a partner in the Natural Gas Star program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 17 years. This program created a partnership between the EPA and industry to identify and share best practices that yield reduced methane emissions. Hess continually looks for opportunities to reduce our methane footprint. We were an industry leader in the use of air for pneumatic controllers in place of natural gas. We also prefer the use of vapor recovery units to capture and use natural gas from tank batteries rather than venting or flaring that gas. We use catalytic converters on our large gas-fired compressor engines to improve hydrocarbon combustion and reduce air emissions. In 2013 Hess launched a bi-fuel installation project by retrofitting diesel engines on seven of the 14 drilling rigs operating for Hess in the Bakken. The retrofit allows the engines to operate on a mixture of natural gas and diesel fuel, resulting in cost savings from the use of gas rather than diesel, as well as several environmental benefits: lower air emissions from the cleaner burn of natural gas compared to diesel, natural gas capture and use at the wellhead, instead of flaring, and fewer diesel delivery truck trips. As part of this project, nine boilers were converted to operate exclusively on natural gas during winter operations. Based on emission testing of three rigs in 2013, average emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) during bi-fuel operation were 23 percent lower than before the retrofit. Based on fuel usage and EPA emission factors, carbon dioxide emissions decreased by 31 percent when operating on bi-fuel. Reductions in particulate matter and sulfur dioxide emissions were not quantified but are known to decrease with an increase of gas usage. The project used 27,413 MCF of gas to replace 240,287 gallons of diesel, resulting in 30 fewer truck deliveries. We also began a wellhead gas capturing project in North Dakota that uses a mobile system to recover high BTU gas from flared locations and produce NGLs and treated lower BTU gas. This project provides both economic and environmental value by converting gas into marketable products, thereby reducing the amount of gas flared and the associated air emissions. The project began with two prototype units and soon expanded to include a 500 MCFD built-for-purpose unit. When operating at full capacity, the 500 MCFD unit is designed to average four to five gallons of NGL per MCF processed. At full capacity and runtime, the potential emission reductions from the 500 MCFD unit are 30 percent for NOx and carbon monoxide, 64 percent for volatile organic compounds and 42 percent for carbon dioxide. Hess has ordered an additional 14 built-for-purpose units for delivery during 2014, bringing the total capacity to 10 MMCFD and a potential production of 1.1 million gallons of NGL per month (over 314,000 barrels per year) with full utilization. In 2014, higher utilization is expected due to an improved design of the new units and better site selection. transportation In North Dakota we have begun to use flat steel hose for freshwater transport instead of trucks. This type of hose collapses flat when not in use, like a fire hose, and it can be used to pipe water directly from the water source to our wells. The 600-foot sections of hose can be connected to lengths of several miles. We conducted our first pilot with this type of hose in September 2013 with four well pads and have now expanded its use to 20 percent of our wells. Use of these flat hoses eliminates the need for trucks to haul water, resulting in less noise and lower GHG emissions, transportation costs and risk of vehicle accidents. The hoses are much easier and less expensive to set up than permanent pipelines and, because they are temporary, have a smaller environmental footprint. During the pilot, we piped more than 500,000 barrels of fresh water using these hoses, eliminating the need for more than 5,000 truckloads. For 2014 we have set a goal to obtain 25 percent of our water in North Dakota via flat hoses rather than trucks. energY use Energy management is an integral part of Hess’ business strategy because it makes economic sense and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Our operations make and purchase energy primarily for power, processing, heating and cooling. In 2013 energy consumption from Hess operated assets was approximately 38 million gigajoules, a 20 percent decrease from 2012 primarily related to the shutdown of the Port Reading refinery in early 2013. Seventy-two percent of our energy use was generated directly by our operations, primarily at our Seminole and Tioga Gas Processing Plants and at our production facilities in North Dakota, South Arne and Equatorial Guinea.

Our assets have spill preparedness and response plans and conduct emergency response exercises. We have several key performance metrics that we track at the asset and enterprise levels, and performance on these metrics is included in the employee bonus formula. Water At Hess, we recognize that fresh water is an increasingly scarce resource, and we are keenly aware of heightened public sensitivity about our industry’s use of water for hydraulic fracturing. Our Environment, Health and Safety Policy commits us to conserving natural resources, including water. That is why we closely monitor our water use and are striving to reduce our water footprint. We also work hard to safeguard underground drinking water aquifers in the areas near our wells. reduction initiatives Our overall water use in 2013 decreased by 12 percent compared to 2012, mainly due to the closure of our Port Reading facility in early 2013. Our Seminole Gas Processing (SGP) plant in West Texas is our biggest single water user, accounting for 59 percent of our usage in 2013. The SGP plant uses water mainly for process cooling and sources it from a Hess owned and operated groundwater well field that withdraws from the Ogallala Aquifer. SGP is located within a region where baseline water stress is categorized as “high risk” based on evaluations we have conducted using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct water risk mapping tool. Water demand in the region is driven primarily by agricultural uses. Texas Water Development Board data for the Llano Estacado region indicate that our withdrawals from the aquifer represent only 0.1 percent of estimated annual water demand. Additional Information is available at the Texas Water Development Board website (www.twdb.texas.gov). Even so, we strive to optimize water use wherever possible. The facility recirculates water in its cooling towers between three to five cycles, and to prevent buildup of solids in the circulating water, a portion is removed as “blowdown.” This blowdown water, totaling 888,000 cubic meters in 2013, is reused in our Permian Production operations to maintain reservoir pressure. We have also begun a feasibility study to evaluate current water sources, inventory process quality and quantity requirements, and identify and analyze efficiency measures. This study is expected to yield good practice recommendations as well (continued on page 47) Million cubic Meters thousand cubic Meters 15 0.024.6  8.5  Exploration and Production (E&P) Groundwater 0.07 125.5  6.5   Seminole Gas Plant 6,210Municipal 0.45 North Dakota 3.8  6.3  1,350 Surface Water Ohio 337 9 International 214  Tioga Gas Plant 188 6 Other U.S. 34 Marketing and Refining (M&R) 3 Retail  1,102 Port Reading 975 Terminals/  1940  Woodbridge 2011 2012 2013 According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, the productivity of oil and natural gas wells is steadily increasing in many basins across the United States because of the increasing precision and efficiency of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas extraction. Hess uses these technologies to develop tight oil and associated gas from the Bakken formation in North Dakota and shale gas and condensate from the Utica Shale formation in Ohio. The potential effects of shale energy operations on the environment, public health and safety are recognized by Hess, and we employ multidisciplinary risk management to drive planning and decision making. Our enterprise risk management process, which is discussed in more detail in the How We Operate section of this report, includes activity aspect identification and technical review as well as value assurance activities. All of our assets also undergo several stages of detailed, activity-based risk assessment during the capture, appraisal, development and production phases. These multidisciplinary risk assessments help us identify mitigation measures we can pursue to ensure protection of the environment, protection of communities in which we operate, and the safety of our combined contractor and employee workforce. We also have a multi-year internal audit plan in place that ensures we perform Environment, Health and Safety audits of our assets regularly. Our North Dakota and Ohio assets were audited in 2012 and 2013. Furthermore, we continue to identify and address stakeholder concerns that may put our “license to operate” at risk, as discussed in the Community and Social Performance section. PROTECTION OF WATER QUALITY To prevent or minimize the potential for our activities to adversely impact local water resources, we continue to make water quality monitoring of groundwater and surface water prior to drilling and completion activities a priority. In Ohio we follow a formal “life of project” operating practice. The objective of this practice is to establish baseline groundwater and surface water conditions at sites and enable the assessment of potential changes in water quality and yield throughout the life of a project. We also perform post-drilling assessment and, depending on risk, we have undertaken the annual sampling of wells and surface water beyond that post-drill assessment at select assets. In North Dakota, the state operates a regional network of groundwater quality monitoring wells. We sample surface water where requested by the landowner and when the surface water body is close to our activities and test the water to assess its suitability for hydraulic fracturing. Groundwater resources are protected by sensible onsite operating practices, including the development of facility spill prevention plans to prevent spills of chemicals used in the well construction and completion process. In 2013 at our North Dakota and Ohio shale energy drilling sites, we employed closed-loop fluid containment systems for drilling fluids. Frac fluid flowback is stored in closed top tanks with secondary containment. These practices prevent potential surface water and groundwater impacts. In addition, the practices allow for the recycling of drilling materials and reduce the volume of waste that needs disposing onsite in lined impoundments or transported offsite for disposal at regulated facilities. WATER USE We understand the importance of managing resources responsibly. As part of our environmental commitment, we aim to reduce our freshwater use. Unconventional shale operations present significant resource challenges due to the amount of fresh, locally sourced water needed to extract hydrocarbons. Hydraulic fracturing accounted for about 13 percent of Hess’ total freshwater consumption in 2013, with North Dakota at 10 percent and Ohio at 3 percent. No flowback water was reused, due to high salinity in North Dakota and limited quantities in Ohio. We are pursuing alternatives to fresh water, including non-potable water sources such as treated domestic wastewater, saline water and frac fluid flowback, to assess their suitability for hydraulic fracturing. In 2013 we conducted a pilot study in North Dakota to test the technical and economic feasibility of using regionally available brackish groundwater for hydraulic fracturing and well maintenance. In the hydraulic fracturing pilot in two Bakken wells, about 14 percent of the frac fluid freshwater volume was replaced by brackish water. The tests proved successful, and we plan to expand the evaluation of brackish water for freshwater substitution. Also in 2013 we tested the viability of using treated sanitary wastewater from the crew camps that house our workers. Though technically suitable, the volume is currently insufficient for fracturing applications. In 2014 we plan to investigate using produced water for hydraulic fracturing. To document what we have learned and to communicate best practices within our operations, we developed an internal fracturing fluid water quality and reuse guideline. WELL INTEGRITY Although the well completion and hydraulic fracturing activity typically occurs miles below the earth’s surface, groundwater is encountered at shallower depths during drilling and well construction. When well installation is through freshwater zones, we investigate their depth and lateral extent in the subsurface prior to designing and constructing the well. This ensures that we protect fresh groundwater and conform to regulatory requirements and internal standards. We take great care to engineer physical barriers to contain the fluids used in drilling, completion and maintenance activities as well as produced oil, gas and water. State agencies require companies to design casing and cementing programs that isolate freshwater intervals. We submit this information in applications for well construction permits, which must be reviewed and approved by regulators. Our wells are lined with multiple layers of steel pipe and encased in cement to depths well below the deepest freshwater zones. Using these and other practices, we have experienced zero cases of failed well integrity in our unconventional operations. Hess applies prudent industry well construction standards globally even where regulations do not require this practice. Well completion designs can vary from asset to asset due to differences in the formation, the management of drilling risks and technology applications. Additional measures are taken to maintain well integrity during hydraulic fracturing. For example: • A “surface casing” is installed from the surface to below the lowest known freshwater zone and then cemented in that interval from the deepest point to the surface around the casing, thereby creating a physical barrier between the materials in the well and the strata containing the groundwater being protected. •	 Inside the surface casing, a second “intermediate” casing is installed and cemented in place. •	 An acoustic cement bond log is selectively employed to ensure a cement barrier is in place, which prevents fluid migration to the surface. • The well completion is performed through a third casing (Ohio) or liner (North Dakota) placed inside the intermediate casing to the depth of the lateral. In North Dakota, a “frac string” is then run and connected to the top of the liner. This provides an additional physical barrier to isolate fluids within the well. •	 Due to potential fracture stimulation interference (i.e., stimulating one well and observing increased pressure on nearby producing wells), nearby wells are shut-in during fracturing activity (based on distance from the well being stimulated), and wellhead systems are tested for integrity prior to any activity. •	 During the hydraulic fracturing activity, pressure is maintained on the annulus between the frac string and the intermediate casing to boost integrity. •	 Real-time microseismic monitoring is conducted during select stimulation operations. This technology allows the mapping of fractures to check if the stimulation was within the targeted interval. FRAC FLUID ADDITIvES Although we expect our fracturing  fluids to never come in contact with groundwater aquifers or surface waters, we know stakeholders are concerned about the chemical makeup of these fluids. We do not use diesel or benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or xylene (BTEX) in frac fluids. We require our hydraulic fracturing contractors to provide non-proprietary individual well data for fracture stimulation water and chemical use. This information is publicly available on the FracFocus website, and we conduct periodic audits of FracFocus submissions to ensure accuracy. We continually look for ways to reduce or eliminate the use of chemical additives or to use safer alternatives. In 2013, for example, we reduced our use of biocides by 50 percent compared to 2012. Biocides are used to hinder bacterial growth in the frac fluid. We encourage fracturing fluid suppliers to use the least toxic chemical formulations available, develop less toxic additives and disclose chemical ingredients. In addition, we participate in stakeholder forums that are engaged in developing science-based frameworks for the evaluation of hazards and risks associated with chemical additives and the promotion of safer and less toxic alternatives. We respect our frac fluid and service providers’ right to keep proprietary formulations confidential, while also supporting the announcement from our Ohio asset’s key supplier to voluntarily disclose all chemical additives. AIR EMISSIONS Air quality impacts from shale energy operations are associated with drilling rig emissions and flaring during flowback and production operations when infrastructure is not available for immediate connection to the wellhead. Where a pipeline connection is unavailable, flaring of the natural gas produced during flowback may be utilized to create a safe working environment during that process. In Ohio, we drilled 29 wells in 2013. Each completed well was flared for only a few days during flow testing before being connected to gas gathering infrastructure that enables producing without flaring. In North Dakota, this type of infrastructure is still being built and is not available to all of our well locations. We have a flaring reduction strategy for North Dakota and have been steadily investing in infrastructure, as discussed in detail in the Climate Change and Energy section of this report. More information on greenhouse gas emissions can be found in the Climate Change and Energy section and on other air emissions in the Environment section. LAND USE Our approach is to minimize land use and reduce the number of well sites needed to develop our acreage. In North Dakota, we continued the transition from a single well per pad to hold the lease to multi-well pad drilling. In 2013 up to 12 wells were sited on a single well pad with shared surface facilities. In Ohio, we employed a geographic information systems (GIS) tool for use during appraisal activities in order to minimize impact on the environment and streamline permitting. The tool incorporates environmental and social baseline data as GIS layers and is used to identify sensitive areas and select well pad locations. TRANSPORTATION IMPACTS Due to the increased truck transport activity associated with the rapid development of the Bakken, we have participated in multi-stakeholder initiatives aimed at minimizing the oil industry’s impact on public roads and traffic congestion. We have collaborated with community partners and state officials in North Dakota to ensure adequate infrastructure funding to improve traffic safety and support  road maintenance. Progress has also  been made through the implementation of local ordinances that regulate oilfield trucking activity. Hess, along with other operators, has built and maintained portions of farm-to-market roads during drilling and completion activities, when the most intensive truck traffic occurs. In 2013 we conducted a pilot project to bring fresh water for hydraulic fracturing operations to the well site by flat steel hose instead of truck transport. More information on this initiative can be found in the Climate Change and Energy section. North DakotaUtica Shale Drilling Operations, Ohio as technology-based solutions focused on reducing the plant’s overall water demand. Our activities in the Bakken formation in North Dakota comprise our second-largest water use. Most of this water is used for hydraulic fracturing. Water is an issue of concern not just for our company, but for our entire industry. Because of that, and in keeping with our broad commitment to promote the conservation of natural resources, we participate in the Energy Water Initiative, a multi-stakeholder forum that evaluates knowledge and data gaps in the shale energy extraction water cycle and promotes research projects to address such gaps. biodiversitY In all of Hess’ global locations – and especially when we operate in sensitive biological habitats – the protection of animal and plant life is carefully factored into our project decision making. Our Environment, Health and Safety Policy calls on us to “identify, assess and manage the environmental, health and safety risks and impacts of our existing and planned operations.” This includes risks and impacts relating to biodiversity and ecosystem services. We routinely conduct biodiversity screenings for major new projects as part of early site evaluation and selection. In many cases, we conduct formal environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) and use them to create mitigation strategies for environmental and biodiversity risks. These ESIAs are performed for Hess by experienced third party consultants in accordance with country specific laws and regulations. The ESIAs include biodiversity baseline studies as well as screening of identified species against the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and threatened, endangered and protected species lists. ESIA results are made public where required. In instances where a full ESIA is not appropriate, we still routinely conduct biodiversity risk screenings and impact assessments. We continue to improve enterprise wide consistency in our execution of ESIAs. In 2013 we made progress in incorporating relevant elements of ESIAs into our initial project risk assessment process. This is part of a multi-year harmonization effort around risk and opportunity identification. In 2013 we conducted several ESIAs and environmental impact assessments (EIAs). In Ghana, for example, we conducted an EIA and developed a Preliminary Environmental Report to support our exploration work there. In the Gulf of Mexico we finalized ESIAs for our Tubular Bells project and began work on an ESIA for our Stampede project. In Southeast Asia, an EIA was completed for the North Malay Basin Early Production System, and an EIA was submitted for the North Malay Basin Full Field Development. In Ohio, we conducted biological and risk assessments on the Indiana Bat, a federally listed endangered species, as well as on the Northern Long-Eared Bat, a species that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has identified as potentially endangered or threatened. Based on those assessments, we were able to ensure that Whales are native to ocean habitat near our operations in offshore Ghana site development would not interfere with the bat’s migration cycles. Throughout the United States in 2013, we identified locations where new assessments and mitigation plans may be warranted, due to the FWS’s plan to make determinations on the potential inclusion of approximately 250 new species on the national endangered and threatened species lists. Our assessments will help to determine if any of the species could be adversely affected by our operations and, if so, what mitigation activities could be put into place. Already, in anticipation of some of these determinations, we have adjusted drilling site locations to accommodate certain habitat features and priorities. During our exploration activities in Ghana in 2013, we utilized best practices for the protection of marine mammals. Hess is a sponsor and active member of the Environmentally Friendly Drilling (EFD) program. EFD is a partnership among multiple oil and gas companies and several environmental organizations, including The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Ducks Unlimited. The primary goal of EFD is to provide unbiased science and develop solutions to address issues associated with oil and gas development. For example, the EFD Technology Integration Program focuses Specifically, we employed marine mammal observers and passive acoustic monitoring during our seismic work. Hess Environmental Affairs maintains a list of IUCN Red List species compiled and updated using environmental due diligence, screening and impact assessment reports.

No Hess asset is located within an IUCN protected area, with the exception of the Sinphuhorm Natural Gas Field in northeastern Thailand, which was divested in early 2014. on commercial development of promising technologies that may help to minimize the environmental impacts of unconventional oil and natural gas drilling. Some of the technologies under investigation include treatment options for flowback water, smaller footprint rigs and improved spill prevention techniques. Another key EFD workflow is the Environmentally Friendly Drilling Systems Scorecard. In development since 2008, the Scorecard provides oil and gas companies Hess is an active member of the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services working group of IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues. In 2013 this working group began to develop a workshop series for oil and gas industry employees, to help build capacity around biodiversity issues and to foster the integration of these issues within oil and gas operations throughout the project life cycle. The two-day workshops are designed to raise awareness of the latest expectations, good practices, tools and practical examples associated with biodiversity and ecosystem management, as well as provide attendees with ideas on how to build the business case for these activities within their organizations. Hess also participates in the Cross Sector Biodiversity Initiative (CSBI), a partnership of IPIECA, the International Council on Mining and Metals and the Equator Principles Association. This initiative brings the mining, oil and gas and financial sectors together to develop and share good practices to safeguard biodiversity with a means for objectively assessing and continually improving their environmental performance and that of their service providers. In 2013 Hess initiated an asset level review to determine performance against the Scorecard. The review will continue in 2014 to identify opportunities for the promotion of best practices and improvements of environmental performance. For more information on EFD, see www.efdsystems.org. and ecosystems. The CSBI aims to bolster each industry sector’s ability to effectively apply the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 6 on Biodiversity, Conservation and the Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources. In 2013 the CSBI launched a “timeline tool” designed to assist project planning in the extractives industries, to better align project development, biodiversity impact management and financial timelines and milestones. Waste Our operations generate a variety of waste streams. These wastes are managed according to the waste management plan specific to each operating location, which is designed to not only comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, but also to protect human health and the environment. Some of the generated wastes include construction debris; scrap metal and wood; oily tank bottoms; contaminated soil; office and domestic waste such as paper, cardboard, and light bulbs; and other waste items specific to drilling and production operations. thousand tonnes 6.9200 Oil Volume in Produced Water Oil Conc. in Produced Water 160 12.0 150 9.0 (tonnes) (ppmv) Non-hazardous 4.3 Hazardous Oil Volume in Water (tonnes)100 149 136140 11.5 119 120 11.0 100 10.5 Oil Concentration in ProducedWater (ppmv) 10 10 80 10.0 60 9.5 In 2013 we generated 196,000 tonnes of waste, a 7 percent increase from the previous year.

We are currently in the process of implementing an electronic waste tracking system, which will improve the consistency of our waste tracking process and ensure reliable, accessible data across the company. disCharges Discharges from our offshore facilities include drilling mud, drill cuttings and produced water. At some of these facilities, these waste streams are reinjected for disposal or reservoir management, whereas others discharge directly to the ocean. Offshore discharges of drilling mud and cuttings in 2013 contained approximately 25 tonnes of oil. This represents a more than 90 percent decrease from the previous year, primarily because we drilled substantially fewer offshore wells. Offshore produced water discharges totaled 16.7million cubic meters in 2013. Produced water discharges had an average oil content of 10 parts per million volume (ppmv), totaling 136 tonnes of oil discharged, primarily from our offshore operations in Equatorial Guinea and Indonesia. Emergency Preparedness Drill, Gulf of Mexico spill prevention We maintain strong relationships with mutual aid and emergency response organizations at the local, regional and global levels to enhance our ability to respond swiftly and effectively to any incidents.

Full environmental impact assessments were conducted prior to commencement of work, with steps taken to address risks that were identified. Great care has been taken to conduct the operations safely and effectively. A guard vessel remains in place during the activities to keep shipping traffic and fishing vessels clear, and the areas are marked as exclusion zones on fishing charts that are made available to fishing vessels via an auto-update process. In almost all cases, all infrastructure is removed and the seabed is returned to its natural state. In isolated instances where it was unsafe to remove the subsea infrastructure, rocks were placed over the infrastructure and it was regraded to permit normal vessel traffic and fishing operations in the future. Nearly all of the infrastructure removed from the seabed – more than 90 percent in 2013 – has been reused or recycled. We anticipate completion of this major undertaking within the next two years. regulatorY CoMplianCe and legal proCeedings In 2013 we paid approximately $550,000 in environmental fines and penalties. We have completed the requirements of the Administrative Consent Agreement with the North Dakota Department of Health (DOH) related to emissions from our production facilities. More detail about that agreement was provided in our 2012 Sustainability Report. In addition, we entered a Consent Decree with the DOH for past emissions exceedances of sulfur dioxide at our Tioga Gas Plant. We paid a $90,000 fine and recently completed facility upgrades as part of the plant expansion. environMental eXpenditures Our capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, were approximately $100 million in 2013. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $65 million for our E&P facilities and approximately $8 million for our downstream businesses in 2014. We have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation for sites that have been affected by our activities. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. As described in Item 7 of our 2013 SEC Form 10-K filing, at year end 2013 Hess’ reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $65 million, which we expect will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Information about estimated asset retirement obligations, which are accounted for separately, is provided in our 2013 SEC Form 10-K filing. Our remediation expenditures totaled approximately $16 million in 2013 and were primarily associated with the downstream businesses. assets in transition Hess has substantially completed a multi-year transformation to a pure play exploration and production (E&P) company. This transformation includes exiting our downstream businesses, including refining, retail, energy marketing and energy trading. In addition, we are creating a more focused E&P portfolio by divesting assets in Indonesia and Thailand and pursuing the monetization of our Bakken midstream assets in North Dakota. In this section we describe the key products and services of the downstream businesses and E&P assets divested in 2013. energY MarKeting Hess completed the sale of the Energy Marketing business to Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc, in November 2013.

Our Synergy with Partners As a leading U.S. Energy as a Service (EaaS) provider, we frequently leverage the power of partnerships to further accelerate our sustainability impact and create shared value not only for our investors but also for our customers, employees, communities, and partners as well. In 2022, we strengthened our existing partnerships and identified new opportunities to work with industry leaders. Our partnerships are instrumental in expanding the reach of clean energy as they allow us to make it more accessible. SPOTLIGHT: THE HOME DEPOT In 2021, Sunnova launched its solar+storage services in 100 stores across Virginia, Maryland, Florida, and Nevada. In 2022, we launched our partnership with The Home Depot in Puerto Rico, expanding our presence to nearly 200 stores across 5 markets —all in geographies with significant weather-related impacts on their respective power grids. Sunnova’s trained professionals staff these Home Depot stores. “With increased power outages and rising electricity rates, homeowners need a better energy service at a better price.

FINANCIAL STEWARDSHIP DRIVES RESULTS Sustained Growth Through Sustainable Investments At AVANGRID we aspire to grow through investments in Networks and Renewables. Here, we will seek to meet our commitments and support the clean energy transition, with a focus on delivering consistent earnings growth and providing stable dividend payments in alignment with our plan for becoming the leading sustainable energy company in the U.S. We believe that this is a better and more balanced way to do business – doing well by doing good for our customers, employees, communities and shareholders. By taking this approach – and by adhering to our ESG+F strategy – we are investing in a more sustainable future while providing innovations, efficiencies and excellence to those we serve. Our financial results affirm our strategy. In 2021, we reported $707 million in net income, a 22% increase from 2020. The investments we’re making to expand our ability to provide affordable, clean energy and to take action to reduce climate impacts include our five-year investment plan. Growth Aligned with Sustainability As a leading sustainable energy company, our business activities are principally focused on addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and specifically SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). As described earlier in this report, these goals are fully integrated into AVANGRID’s strategy and sustainability policy. The investments we’re making to expand our ability to provide affordable, clean energy and to take action to reduce climate impacts are detailed in our 5-year investment plan. We’re investing to modernize and strengthen Avangrid Networks’ energy grid, through advanced metering infrastructure and through projects that will improve resiliency, safety, reliability and transmission. We are also investing in Avangrid Renewables’ development of our pioneering offshore wind projects and the buildout of additional solar and onshore wind resources across the U.S. Green Financing In 2021, we added to our existing $2,100 million green bond portfolio by issuing our first utility green bonds to finance investments in LED street lighting, advanced metering infrastructure and system resiliency. We issued $475 million (face value at issuance) of green bonds at two of our utilities (NYSEG for $350 million, RG&E for $125 million) and priced bonds that were issued in January 2022 at a third utility (UI for $150 million). These issuances increased our total green bond portfolio to $2,725 million as of the publication date. In addition to being an early adopter of green bonds, we were also one of the first U.S. companies to execute a sustainability-linked credit facility in 2018. In 2021, we refinanced and upsized our credit facility to $3,575 million and maintained the sustainability feature linking the pricing in that facility to our emissions intensity target. of these markets toward providing lower-cost financing, helping us meet our financial goals while creating a clean energy future, and bringing our ESG+F strategy to life. $475 million green bonds in New York $150 million priced bonds in Connecticut In September of 2021, we closed on a $2.4 billion construction and term loan for Vineyard Wind 1, making the project the first commercial-scale offshore wind facility in the U.S. to reach financial close. For this groundbreaking transaction, we were awarded the Global ESG Deal of the Year by Project Finance International and the North American Renewables Deal of the Year by IJGlobal. Construction on Vineyard Wind 1 also began in September 2021, and we expect it will create 3,100 job years over the project period. Along with our investments to increase resilience and reliability across our Networks business, projects like Vineyard Wind 1 reflect our commitment to ensure the dollars we invest contribute significantly to a clean energy future while delivering strong financial returns. Green Financing SECURITY  ALLOCATION  2021 IMPACT  Issuing Entity  Designation  Net Proceeds ($ millions) % Allocated  Project  Type  Location (State)  Capacity (MW)  In-Service Date  Allocated ($ millions)  Output (GWh)  CO2 Avoided (mt)1  AVANGRID  3.15% Notes due  $595  Amazon Wind Farm U.S. East  Onshore Wind  NC  208  Dec ‘16-Feb ‘17  $395  12/1/2024 (05351WAA1)  Gala Solar Plant  Solar  OR  56  Oct ‘17  100  943  688,260  Issued 11/21/2017  Twin Butte II  Onshore Wind  CO  75  Dec ‘17  100  100%  339  $595  AVANGRID  3.80% Notes due  $745  La Joya2  Onshore Wind  NM  90  Feb ‘21 & Jun ‘21  $116  6/1/2029 (05351WAB9)  Montague  Onshore Wind  OR  201  Oct ‘19  126  Issued 5/16/2019  Karankawa  Onshore Wind  TX  307  Dec ‘19  191  1,532  1,085,756  Patriot  Onshore Wind  TX  226  Jun ‘19  182  Otter Creek  Onshore Wind  IL  151  Mar ‘20  130  100%  975  $745  AVANGRID  3.20% Notes due  $745  Colorado Green  Wind Repower  CO  162  Dec ‘20  $ 71  4/15/2025  Roaring Brook  Onshore Wind  NY  80  Oct ‘21  80  (05351WAC7)  Issued 4/9/2020  La Joya2  Onshore Wind  NM  216  Feb ‘21 & Jun ‘21  278  899  637,096  Montague II Solar  Solar PV  OR  162  Jun ‘22  164  Lund Hill  Solar PV  WA  150  May ‘22  151  100%  770  $745  AVANGRID  Tax Equity  $438  Montague  Onshore Wind  OR  201  Oct ‘19  $138  Aeolus VII  Karankawa  Onshore Wind  TX  307  Dec ‘19  200  Funded 2/2020,  1,007  713,992  4/2020  Otter Creek  Onshore Wind  IL  151  Mar ‘20  100  100%  659  $438  AVANGRID Tax Equity $128 Patriot Funded 6/2019 100%  Patriot Onshore Wind TX 226 Jun ‘19 $128  233 165,359  AVANGRID Tax Equity $199 Aeolus VIII Funded 11/2021 100%  Colorado Green Wind Repower CO 162 Dec ‘20 $104 Roaring Brook Onshore Wind NY 80 Oct ‘21 95 242 $199  335 237,585  Green Financing SECURITY  ALLOCATION  2021 IMPACT  Issuing Entity  Designation  Net Proceeds ($ millions) % Allocated  Project  Type  Location (State)  In-Service Date  Allocated ($ millions)  Energy Savings  CO2 Avoided (mt)1  NYSEG  2.15% Notes due  $347  Energy Efficiency  Advanced Metering  NY  2020-2021  $ 57  See footnote 3  10/1/2031  Infrastructure (AMI)  (649840CT0)  Energy Efficiency  LED Street Lighting  NY  2020-2021  20  17 GWh  12,164  Issued 9/4/2021  Climate Change Adaptation/Resiliency  Resiliency  NY  2020-2021  151  See footnote 4  66%  $228  RG&E  2.91% 1st  $123  Energy Efficiency  Advanced Metering  NY  2020-2021  $ 33  See footnote 3  Mortgage Bonds due  Infrastructure (AMI)  12/15/2051 (771367D*7)  Energy Efficiency  LED Street Lighting  NY  2020-2021  1  0.2 GWh  118  Issued 12/15/2021  Climate Change Adaptation/Resiliency  Resiliency  NY  2020-2021  24  See footnote 4  47%  $ 58  UI 2.25% Notes due $149 1/31/2032 (910637V@3) Issued 1/31/2022 32%  Energy Efficiency LED Street Lighting CT 2020-2021 $ 9 Climate Change Resiliency CT 2020-2021 39 Adaptation/Resiliency $ 48  14 GWh 9,697 See footnote 5  Notes: All Renewables projects are wholly owned by AVANGRID.

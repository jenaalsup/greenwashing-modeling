Letter from the Chairman and CEO rex w. tiLLerson, chairMan and ceo “Without leadership by example and without thoughtful, honest, and objective self-assessment, no system is sustainable.” Statement to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, November 9, 2010 2010 Corporate Citizenship Report 3 Welcome to the 2010 Corporate Citizenship Report This past year, everyone with an interest in the energy industry—and in corporate citizenship more generally— was reminded of the critical importance of corporate accountability and responsibility. The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico last summer shook our industry and the confidence of many of our stakeholders. After 14,000 deepwater wells drilled successfully around the world, this isolated incident caused many to ask fundamental questions about what it means to be a good corporate citizen in the energy industry. The incident was a painful reminder about the importance of integrity and responsible operations. As you will read in this report, ExxonMobil remains committed to a systematic and unwavering focus on corporate responsibility at all levels. Our own experience after the Exxon Valdez oil spill fundamentally shaped the way our company understands and manages risk. It motivated us to recommit ourselves—that safety, operational excellence, environmental protection, financial discipline, and ethical standards must be a part of our business each and every day. This year’s Corporate Citizenship Report details our systematic approach to managing our global operations, and the measures we employ to successfully operate in a variety of environments. It describes how we address the challenges of developing energy resources—and supplying that energy to world markets while delivering a return to our shareholders. There is no question that this requires the constant management of risk. The sustainability of our business is based on our ability to apply consistent processes and systems in our daily operations to ensure that risk is identified, planned for, and successfully managed. We recognize that embedding the highest standards of safety, environmental performance, ethics, economic stewardship, and community engagement in every aspect of our activities is critical to protecting local communities and supporting our company’s long-term success. It is also critical to meeting the shared challenge that the world faces: how to provide the energy required for eco.nomic growth and improved standards of living while protecting the environment. This challenge is acute because oil and natural gas reserves are often located in remote and sensitive regions. To develop these resources while respecting the local environments and communities in which they are found, we must employ the highest indus.try safety, environmental, and social standards. For example, our project in Papua New Guinea traverses areas requiring careful environmental and cultural planning. As you will read in this report, we are conducting social and environmental surveys in that country and are adapting our project activities accordingly. To meet growing global energy demand, society will increasingly rely upon new ways to produce resources. One example is Canada’s oil sands—the second largest oil reserves in the world. Investments in the devel.opment and deployment of improved technologies for extraction and transport of this valuable resource are critical. And when done successfully, these technologies can minimize impacts to the environment. Natural gas is another example. Vast amounts of natural gas are located in shale formations around the world. By combining technology with operational excellence, we can safely unlock these supplies for the benefit of this generation and the next. We recognize that there are multiple viewpoints on the appropriate production and use of these resources—as there are with all energy sources—and we are committed to constructive engagement with our stakeholders on these issues. 2010 was a year of significant challenge for the energy industry. We know that the confidence of stakeholders is critical to the industry’s ability to operate and to be successful. From ExxonMobil’s perspective, we are committed to maintaining this confidence by continuing to operate safely, responsibly, and in a manner that promotes the long-term economic, environmental, and social health of our communities. We hope you find our 2010 Corporate Citizenship Report useful in understanding how ExxonMobil addresses challenges in these important areas. We welcome your comments. 4    exxonmobil.com About ExxonMobil ExxonMobil uses innovation and technology to deliver energy and petrochemical products to meet the world’s growing demand.

It is this challenge that lies at the heart of discussions about sustainability and the energy industry. Without energy, there can simply be no improvement in the quality of life of the world’s citizens. ExxonMobil is committed to addressing the challenge of sustainability—balancing economic growth, social development, and environmental protection so future generations are not compromised by actions taken today. We take our commitments in these areas very seriously; they are critical to our ability to do our job well, every day. balancing economic growth, social development, and environmental protection Business strategies1: upstream • Identify and selectively capture the highest-quality exploration opportunities • Maximize profitability of existing oil and gas production • Invest in projects that deliver superior returns • Capitalize on growing natural gas and power markets • Maximize resource value through high-impact technologies and integrated solutions downstream • Maintain best-in-class operations • Provide quality, valued products, and services to our customers • Lead industry in efficiency and effectiveness • Capitalize on integration across ExxonMobil businesses • Selectively invest for resilient, advantaged returns • Maximize value from leading-edge technologies chemical In this report, we articulate how we address the challenge of sustainability through six focus areas: Safety, Health, and the Workplace (page 12); Corporate Governance (page 20); Environmental Performance (page 24); Managing Climate Change Risks (page 32); Economic Development (page 38); and Community Engagement and Human Rights (page 44). These focus areas span the length and breadth of our business, and we recognize the critical importance of continuous improvement and excellence in each area. We work in sensitive environmental and social locations to find and produce new sources of energy. Many of our refining facilities are located close to homes and businesses. We supply essential chemical products to make other industries—such as modern computing, medical supplies, and automobiles—possible. In all such activi.ties—and in the many others, which together comprise our business—a constant focus on sustainability is critical to our success. And, given the events of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, we are reminded of the fundamental importance of operations integrity. Without a commitment to responsible operations and careful planning in all activities, the energy industry cannot lay claim to being sustainable. It is the goal of this report to outline for stakeholders how ExxonMobil puts our com.mitment to sustainability into practice every day. We invite comment and dialogue on this important area from all who take an interest in our company and our industry. 1Business strategies referenced in the 2010 Financial & Operating Review 6 exxonmobil.com The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030 The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030, our long-term forecast of supply and demand trends, projects global energy demand in 2030 to be about 35 percent higher than it was in 2005—even with substantial gains in efficiency. Meeting this rising demand for energy in a safe and environmentally responsible way is ExxonMobil’s mission and is a key challenge facing governments and societies worldwide. The scale and nature of this challenge is described in the Outlook, which we use to help guide our investment decisions. We also share it publicly to encourage broader understanding of energy issues. Doha, Qatar. Many of the hallmarks of human progress—the improvements in how people live, work, and stay safe and healthy—are enabled by energy. As societies and technologies develop, people’s energy usage will continue to evolve. Population and economic growth drive demand Population growth continues to be a key factor behind rising energy demand. Today, the world’s population is approaching 7 billion, but as personal incomes grow, population expansion will slow—a trend emerging in the last decade. By 2030, the global population will reach about 8 billion. Other major influences on energy demand include economic growth and increasing prosperity. From 2005 to 2030, the global economy will expand at an average rate of 2.8 percent per year, but growth will be fastest in Non-OECD1 countries. By 2030, demand in these nations will rise by more than 70 percent, led by China and India, while energy demand in OECD countries will remain essentially flat as efficiency gains help offset demand growth. Energy-related CO2 emissions growth moderates Meeting the world’s energy challenges goes beyond balancing supply and demand; it also requires managing the risks posed by rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We project global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will increase about 25 percent from 2005 to 2030. Although substantial, this increase is significantly lower than the pro.jected 35-percent growth in energy demand, reflecting expected efficiency gains and a shift toward less carbon-intensive energies over time. Globally, we anticipate efficiency gains will not only curb global energy demand growth by almost 65 percent through 2030, but also contribute significantly to offsetting 75 percent of the potential growth in CO2 emissions. In OECD countries, CO2 emissions will decline through 2030 even as economic output grows by more than 60 percent and population grows by 10 percent. This shift will be spurred in part by government policies designed to reduce emissions by impos.ing a cost on CO2. For the purposes of the Outlook, ExxonMobil anticipates that by 2020, adoption of these policies will be equivalent to adding CO2 costs of about $30 per metric ton in OECD countries, rising to $60 per metric ton by 2030. At these levels, natural gas and other lower-carbon energy sources become increasingly cost competitive, particularly in the power generation sector. Non-OECD countries will see gains in energy efficiency and increase their share of cleaner fuels, but the resulting CO2 savings are more than offset by the tremendous rise in energy demand needed to fuel rapid economic development. By 2030, these nations will account for approximately two-thirds of energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide. Diverse mix of reliable, affordable energy sources required With the scale of the world’s energy needs already enormous, it is clear that a mix of reliable, affordable energy sources must continue to be developed in order to provide the energy needed for economic growth and societal development. As new technologies advance, our energy sources evolve—growing cleaner and more diverse. Through 2030, there will be significant shifts in the composition of the world’s energy, but oil, natural gas, and coal are projected to remain the most significant energy sources. 1Dividing the world’s nations into two groups—according to membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)—is useful for studying energy trends. This is because the more than 30 members of the OECD—including Australia, most of Europe, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United States—generally have more mature economies and well-developed patterns of energy use. Non-OECD countries will have different energy-use patterns because their economies are rapidly advancing. By 2030, they will provide just under 80 percent of global energy, down slightly versus today. Nuclear, along with wind, solar, and biofuels, is projected to grow rapidly, sup.plying about 8 percent and 3 percent of the world’s energy needs in 2030, respectively. Liquid supplies diversify By 2030, total liquids demand is expected to reach slightly more than 100 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Because of their high energy density, availability, and con.venience, liquid fuels will continue to be the fuel of choice for transportation—the sector responsible for about 85 percent of projected liquids demand growth. Resources requiring advanced technologies to unlock supplies that exist in geographically challenging locations or that require more complex extraction technologies will play an increasing role in meeting liquids demand. By 2030, deepwater and oil sands resources will likely contribute close to 20 percent of worldwide liquids supply, while natural gas liquids will contribute an additional 10 percent. Natural gas adapts to growing needs Natural gas is expected to be the fastest-growing major fuel source through 2030, with its share of global energy rising from about 20 percent to about 25 percent, displacing coal as the second most prominent source of energy worldwide (see case study, page 30). This rapid expansion of natural gas demand through 2030 reflects several important factors. One is a steep rise in Non-OECD demand in the residential, commercial, industrial, and power generation sectors. The second is a shift away from coal for power generation in order to reduce CO2 emissions in OECD countries. Given its abundance, affordability, dependabil.ity, and properties as a cleaner-burning fuel, expanded use of natural gas can help meet growing demand while enabling advancement of environmental goals worldwide. Taking on the world’s toughest energy challenges Supplying reliable, affordable energy in a safe and environmentally sound manner is critical to enabling advancement and pros.perity. Meeting growing demand will require an integrated set of solutions to expand all economic energy sources, accelerate gains in efficiency, reduce energy-related CO2 emissions, and develop new energy tech.nologies. To provide solutions at the scale embodied in the Outlook, the world will need tremendous levels of investment sustained over decades; an unwavering drive for 2010 Corporate Citizenship Report 7 Global Progress Drives Demand Population Gross domestic product (GDP) Energy demand (billion) (trillion 2005$) (quadrillion BTUs) Non-OECD Non-OECD Non-OECD OECD OECD OECD Annual growth Annual growth Annual growth 2005–2030 average 0.9% 2005–2030 average 2.8% 2005–2030 average 1.2% 18 100 1200 2005–2030 Energy savings through ˜ 300 efficiency gains quads 9 50 600 1980 2005 2030 1980 2005 2030 1980 2005 2030 Diverse Fuel Mix Meets Demand Demand and supply (quadrillion BTUs) 2005 2030 Energy sources: Oil Gas Coal Biomass Nuclear Hydro and geothermal Wind, solar, and biofuels ~300 300 300 0.7% 2.0% ~170 0.7% 150 150 Percentages represent annual growth/year 2005–2030 0.4% 2.3% 2.1% 9.9% Energy sources Energy Energy growth savings Energy-Related CO2 Emissions Growth Moderates CO2emissions Emissions per capita Emissions per GDP (billion metric tons) (metric tons/person) (metric tons/2005$k GDP) Non-OECD 2005 2005 OECD 2030 2030 40 12 2.0 20 6 1.0 1980 2005 2030 OECD Non-OECD OECD Non-OECD innovation, new technology, and operational On the Web: excellence; and reliable policies that promote The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030 a level playing field for pursuing a diverse exxonmobil.com/energyoutlook mix of commercially viable energy solutions.

Our increasingly diverse group of stakeholders includes governments, non.governmental organizations (NGOs), communities, shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, and others. External engagement is fundamental to how we conduct our business. Ongoing dialogue and engagement with our stakeholders provide opportunities to listen to concerns, identify material issues, and benchmark performance against expecta.tions. We focus our engagement efforts primarily on groups and individuals directly impacted by, or who have a direct impact on, our operations. Our engagement takes many forms, including internal and external one-on-one and group dialogues and briefings; senior executive speeches; quarterly earnings teleconferences; focus groups; community consultations; e-mail communications; publications, such exxonMobiL stakehoLders GOAL  EXAMPLE  Collaborate with  Oil spill response  public policy  leaders on issues  of mutual interest  In April 2010, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico highlighted the importance of effective emergency response practices. ExxonMobil engaged with policymakers and industry leaders to address capabili.ties in oil spill prevention and emergency response. Through joint industry task forces, congressional briefings, and multiple consultations with the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling and the U.S. Departments of Interior and Energy, we supplied input into the response mechanisms and future policy development. For information about our participation in the development of a marine well containment system, see page 27. as the Corporate Citizenship Report, Summary Annual Report, The Outlook for Energy, and ExxonMobil Perspectives; and content on our Web site. It can be challenging to address certain stakeholder issues that directly conflict with our business practices. Additionally, it is not uncommon for us to encounter oppos.ing stakeholder views. For example, many diverse viewpoints exist surrounding shale gas development using hydraulic fracturing (see page 30). We listen to all perspectives on the energy debate and consider these discussions in long-term planning. GOAL  EXAMPLE  Enhance trust and  Operational trans- communication  parency through  through knowledge  guided tours  sharing  The Esso refinery and chemical facility at Fawley is the largest in the United Kingdom.

In response to feedback, in 2010, the Production Company delivered the ExxonMobil Fundamentals of Safety course to 600 employees and contractors. Participants in this two-and.a-half-day program learned best practices in safety leadership and developed safety improvement plans. Employees who completed the training demonstrated improved behavior and a commitment to positively influence safety. 2Number includes XTO Energy Inc. employees following the June 2010 all-stock transaction with ExxonMobil. 10 exxonmobil.com Performance Data Efficiently collecting and managing data related to our six citizenship focus areas and the overall financial health of the Corporation is essential to measure performance. To ensure that the citizen.ship data provided in our performance data table and elsewhere in this report are relevant, we selected indicators based on guidance provided by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) and cross-referenced the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. Long-term financial resource management ExxonMobil’s responsibility is to provide competitively priced energy supplies to our customers while delivering value to our share.holders. Because the investments we make today can impact our financial performance for decades, we utilize a disciplined approach to pursue and select the most attractive investment opportunities. In 2010, we contin.ued investing at record levels—more than $32 billion in capital and exploration expen.ditures for the year—and we expect to invest more than $165 billion over the next five years. creating shareholder value. We seek to deliver superior shareholder value through disciplined capital investments, operational excellence, and the maintenance of a long.term industry perspective. We expect this approach to translate into strong earnings and cash flows throughout the business cycle, which provides the basis for business invest.ments and distributions to shareholders. Approximately 2.5 million individual sharehold.ers own about 50 percent of ExxonMobil’s common stock. The remaining 50 percent of shares are owned by institutions, includ.ing those that manage mutual funds and pension funds. For more than 100 years, the Corporation has paid dividends. In 2010, shareholder distributions from dividend pay.ments and net share purchases totaled more than $20 billion. Annual dividend payments per share have increased for 28 consecutive years—by 5 percent in 2010 and 53 percent over the last five years. reserves replacement. At year-end 2010, ExxonMobil had proved reserves totaling nearly 25 billion oil-equivalent barrels or nearly 15 years of reserves life at current production levels. In 2010, we replaced 209 percent of production including property sales and 211 percent excluding property sales. Our five-year average replacement ratio was 131 percent. We have replaced more than 100 percent of production for 17 consec.utive years, as determined on ExxonMobil’s basis, reflecting our strategic focus on resource capture and a disciplined approach to investment and project execution. taxes. In 2010, ExxonMobil’s worldwide tax expenses amounted to more than $89 billion, about three times our earnings in the same period.

Health And SafetyLet’s Talk SafetySafety information and trainings are regularly communicated to all employees on a regular basis through internally published statistics, a dedicated section of our company SharePoint site, alerts regarding specific issues, and monthly all-hands safety briefings.At Clearway, our top priority is the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we work. We constantly strive to be role models within our industry and encourage our employees to maintain a “safety always” culture. We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and to creating an inclusive safety culture where safety is everyone’s job. 2020 was our second full year of operations as a standalone company, and once again our employees delivered strong safety performance with injury rates below industry averages. We continuously evaluate our approach to safety and make ongoing improvements to achieve top-decile safety performance.Key metrics regarding our environmental and safety performance are communicated to and evaluated by our owners on a quarterly basis as well as annually. 2020 ESG Report  |  31 HEALTH AND SAFETY2020 Health and Safety HighlightsProactively handling the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a mitigation and response procedure atthe onset of the crisis and creating a COVID-19 TaskForce that had regular virtual meetings throughout2020 to discuss general and regional strategies.Regular review and updating of our safety standards. We have approximately 70 safety policies and we systematically review and update a subset of these each year. Major policies pertain to high-risk activities like working at heights and electrical safety standards, as well as activities with significant impacts to the organization like leadership engagement, communication, and employee participation.Routine and ongoing safety assessments at each of our sites, including an annual safety audit. In addition, each of our sites has a unique emergency action plan that is tested annually in coordination with local emergency responders.  Expanding our root cause analysis and incident investigation training to deepen our institutional knowledge and encourage site managers to proactively apply lessons learned to new situations so issues can be proactively avoided. In 2020, select managers and front-line employees participated in Management Oversight and Risk Tree (MORT) training to gain skills in identifying, analyzing, and evaluating safety risks and incident investigation techniques.Strengthening collaboration and communication between our construction and O&M teams when working on repowering projects. While both teams prioritize safety and efficiency, their work doesn’t normally overlap and they have slightly different practices and cultures. The need to harmonize their approaches was identified as a “lesson learned” from the 2019 repowering of the Elbow Creek wind site. In 2020 we conducted a series of meetings between the teams working on the Wildorado and Langford wind site repowerings and were successful in identifying opportunities to strengthen working relationships and turnover processes. OUR SAFETY METRICS Our safety metrics reflect data for employees and individualcontract workers under the direct supervision of Clearway’s O&Mteams. While we monitor the safety performance of our engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors on an ongoing basis to ensure that they meet our high standards, we do not report their metrics.Clearway Energy Group (Renewables O&M Safety Performance)METRIC NUMBER RATE 2019 2020 2019 2020 Worker Hours 1,038,319 1,275,740 N/A N/A OSHA Recordable Injuries 8 5 1.54 0.78 Fatalities 0 0 0.00 0.00 Lost Time Injuries 2 3 0.39 0.47 Days Away, Restricted Duty and Transfers (DART) 3 3 0.58 0.47 First Aid 23 17 N/A N/A Clearway Energy, Inc.

This included issuing batch training assignments to site staff to make the most of downtime and adjusting live trainings to virtual settings wherever possible, as well as increasing communications and modifying their format to provide critical information to the sites in a timely manner. As a result of these efforts, Clearway’s training department has a more robust and flexible program that will be well-positioned to respond to potential disruptions in the future.In total, our training department issued more than 23,000 learning assignments to more than 900 employees with an 87% completion rate. Approximately 11,500 of these assignments were compliance-related training for site personnel, and these were completed at a rate of 97%, with 26 of our sites achieving 100% completion. The remainder of the assignments were focused on improving employees’ abilities in areas ranging from technical skills to leadership. High Marks from the People Who Matter MostTraining on environmental health and safety is a part of every new employee’s orientation, and in our first two annual employee engagement surveys (conducted in 2019 and 2020), our highest scores were in the category of safety.

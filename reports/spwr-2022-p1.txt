About Our rapidly changing climate and its impact on our planet is not a challenge that any one group—governments, companies, scientists, activists or individuals—can solve alone. We need an all-hands approach—working together and from different angles—to cut carbon emissions if we are to avoid the worst impacts of a warming planet. SunPower’s 2022 Environmental Social Governance (ESG) report focuses on our progress against our targets in decarbonizing our business, promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives, advancing employee safety, as well as how the company is delivering value to its customers through the electrification of homes and transportation. The data in this report is from our 2022 fiscal year (January 3, 2022 to January 1, 2023). For more information about our sustainability strategy, see SunPower’s sustainability website here. About 05 2022 Highlights SunPower helps more American homeowners and builders adopt solar energy systems as the U.S. races to decarbonize and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to power our homes and communities. About—2022 Highlights 06 48 States Our Footprint As of January 1, 2023, SunPower has 4,710 full-time employees worldwide.

The company also completed its transformation into a residential-only solar, storage and financial services company with the sale of the Commercial and Industrial Solutions (CIS) and Light Commercial (CVAR) businesses in early 2022. SunPower’s future involves making sustainable lifetime relationships with homeowners with a world-class customer experience backed by the industry’s best people, technology and equipment. Our residential installed base was 4.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 and we added nearly 83,100 customers (a record high), launched a Dealer Accelerator Program and increased our dealer network by 28% to more than 850 across 48 states. We saw continued improvement in total gross margin at 21.8% in 2022, from 21.0% in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA per customer2 for 2022 was $2,100, on track toward our target model of $3,000-$4,000 by 2025. Our balance sheet remains de-levered, with remaining net recourse debt of only $48M at the end of 2022, the lowest level in over 10 years. Cumulative Residential Total Residential Customers Gross Margin as a % Adjusted Residential EBITDA Net Recourse Debt Installed Base (Thousands) of Revenue Per Customer2 (Millions $) (Gigawatts) 510 (%) ($) 297427 28122% 2,6003514.2 2,100 2,10021%3.6 3.1 20% 48 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 1 Financial numbers are reflected on a Non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.

About—Financial Highlights 11 We experienced annual customer growth in 2022 of 48% year-over-year, and we continued to see strength across all our sales channels with 108% year-over-year customer growth directly from SunPower platforms and channels. Our backlog also ended the year strong with 33,000 retrofit customers and another 19,000 in the new homes channel. SunVault® energy storage system sales continued at a steady pace with a 17% bookings attach rate within the SunPower Direct channel in the second half of the year, and we expect higher customer interest in California this year as a result of Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM 3.0) policy changes that go into effect on April 15, 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022 includes a 10-year extension of the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and solar paired with storage, in addition to a brand-new 30% tax credit for standalone battery storage. It also includes several important bonus credits that apply to systems leased to customers. SunPower stands well positioned to monetize these benefits for both customers and the company through a combination of stronger sales, increased pricing power and our potential qualification for bonus credits. For example: 1 To increase the likelihood that we qualify for the 10% Domestic Content bonus credit, we are adding more domestically manufactured PV modules to our supplies for 2023 and we expect to bring in additional domestic suppliers in 2024 and onward. 2 For the 10%–20% Low-Income bonus credit, SunPower plans to build new tools for dealers, activating SunPower Direct to sell lease and reconfiguring marketing operations to capture more qualifying customers. 3 For the Energy Communities credit, we are mapping out these communities so that this bonus can be incorporated into our sales tools. In 2022, we announced our collaboration with General Motors to develop a new home energy system that will enable its compatible electric vehicles (EV) to provide backup energy to a properly equipped home with bi-directional charging, expected to launch in the fall of 2023. SunPower was also named GM’s exclusive solar provider, allowing us to reach even more homeowners. See also Innovation section. We also continue to develop our virtual power plant offerings. And, our strategic relationship with OhmConnect further extends the customer value proposition. Continuing platform investment in product and digital innovation will support our dealers, grow sales, improve our financial products and will add customer control and monitoring of systems for optimum efficiency. We estimate that the U.S. Total Addressable Market3 consists of nearly 100 million potential U.S. customers with rooftops suitable for solar. Within this market, we estimate that more than 70 million could now reduce their monthly electric bills with solar, supported by the recent 10-year extension of the 30% investment tax credit for solar and storage, and rising utility bills. With a tight residential customer-focused strategy and a growing geographic footprint, we are excited to lean into the opportunities in front of us. Policy and Market Developments: A Year of Progress The solar panel, battery storage, electrification and grid services marketplace is complex and largely driven by local, state and federal policy decisions. SunPower is committed to investing in proactive public policy advocacy efforts that enable greater access to clean energy bill savings and resiliency benefits for all Americans—while also making an impact in decarbonizing communities across the country. SunPower is proud to work with like-minded trade associations and non.profit organizations, including the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Advanced Energy United (AEU), Local Solar for All, Clean Energy for America and Vote Solar to accelerate the pace of residential clean energy deployment. We formed a new partnership with Rewiring America, a leading electrification nonprofit focused on electrifying homes, businesses and communities by developing accessible, actionable data and tools. We also work with more than a dozen state trade associations and partner with grassroots advocacy organizations, including Solar United Neighbors, the Solar Access Coalition and the Solar Rights Alliance; dozens of environmental, consumer and justice organizations at the state and national level; and other research, academic and policy institutions to promote favorable public policies. 2022 saw the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—a historic law which represents the United States’ largest investment to date in clean energy deployment and associated climate change emissions reduction. SunPower was deeply engaged throughout the entire legislative process since the bill’s initial inception in the fall of 2021. Our policy and strategy team worked tirelessly with lawmakers, industry groups and non-profit organizations to shape the bill to be maximally advantageous to our customers, our industry and our planet. Since the law’s passage, we have remained engaged with regulators as they work to implement the bill nationwide. The IRA is already creating substantial benefits for American consumers via the expansion and long-term extension of the federal ITC for solar systems and a new ITC for battery storage systems. As additional incentives within the law are implemented, we expect our value proposition to become even more appealing to existing and potential customers. At the state level, we made progress on a full stack of state legislative and regulatory policies in 2022, including the expansion of the Net Energy Metering program in Massachusetts, the defeat of anti-solar legislation in Florida and Hawaii, the development of new incentive programs in New Jersey, Colorado and California, and the expansion of consumer solar programs in new growth markets like Michigan. Additionally, SunPower was instrumental in ensuring that the final decision on NEM 3.0 in California did not contain any of the strongest anti-solar provisions in the initial proposed decision. About— Policy and Market Developments: A Year of Progress 13 Our Goals and Progress We recognize the critical role we play—both in the solar industry and the American economy—and know that it is our responsibility to use this position to create a more sustainable, equitable and inclusive society. As we look ahead to the future of both our company and the planet, we’ve defined clear benchmarks covering sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) to help hold us accountable in these efforts. Our Goals and Progress 14 Goals and Progress Topic Goals Measure Baseline1 2022 Target Year Community People Environment Establish a net zero carbon emissions program for our material and 1 GHG Mt / MWd 28 19 0 2030 Greenhouse Gas freight network2 Emissions 2 Convert our U.S. fleet vehicles to hybrid or electric vehicles % 0 5 90 2030 Through the installation of solar systems, enable our customers to generate 200 Metric Tons (Mt) of Carbon Emissions 3 80M 123M 200M 2030 million metric tons of carbon emissions equivalent reduction3 CO2e NF26 29 35 4 Increase representation of women U.S. leaders % 2025 F 0 010 Leadership diversity4,5 NF5 515 5 Increase representation of Black and Hispanic/Latinx U.S. leaders % 2025 F 0 010 NF34 36 406 Increase representation of women U.S. employees % 2025 25X25: Increasing F 4 5 10 workforce diversity5 NF 8 16 25 7 Increase representation of Black and Hispanic/Latinx U.S. employees % 2025 F 13 43 25 Achieve the target ratio of new U.S. residential customers (single and multi.25x25: Expanding access 8 family) added within 2025 that are made up of people who live in historically % 16 17 25 2025 for customers disadvantaged communities 25x25: Ensuring Achieve the target ratio of new dealers and subcontractors added within 2025 that % 15 12 25 2025 9industry equity are owned by women and people of color Community engagement 10 Contribute employee volunteer hours Cumulative Hours 25k 30k 40k 2030 1 Baseline is 2020 and excludes Blue Raven Solar, which was acquired in September 2021. 2 Excludes Blue Raven Solar. 3 Cumulative since 2005. 4 Leaders are defined as those at director level and above. 5 Goals 4-7 have been updated to separately establish targets for non-field (NF) and field (F) positions, see page 27 for further discussion.

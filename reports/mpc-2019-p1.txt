Our Products Enhance Life’s Possibilities We make the everyday necessities of life, from the fuel in our vehicles to the paved roads that bring us to our loved ones. The petrochemicals we manufacture are used in making vehicle components, clothing, material in our phones, electronic equipment, hospital equipment, furniture, insulation material, adhesives, paints and inks, helmets and other protective gear. Virtually every product and service the world uses is better and more affordable because of the products we manufacture. • Feeding the World – Wherever large-scale agriculture takes place, petroleum fuels make it possible to plow, plant, fertilize, harvest and transport food to where it’s needed. Our products help elevate communities out of poverty and into prosperity. • Building Our World – Whether building homes and workplaces or bridges and cell towers, construction projects rely on petroleum to not only run cranes, backhoes, cement trucks and generators, but also for building materials including insulation, roofing shingles, paint and vinyl siding. • Putting Everything within Your Reach – If you order items for delivery, or go to stores to find them full of merchandise, petroleum fuels make it possible. Almost everything we buy comes to us through a combination of trucks, planes, trains and marine vessels powered by petroleum fuels. Throughout our company’s history, we have adapted and evolved to meet society’s changing needs. We will continue to address the complex challenges of sustainably providing affordable, abundant and reliable sources of energy, including renewable fuels. Bathroom Bedroom Take A Look • Medicine • Curtains • Toilet Seat • Eye Glasses • Toiletries, Make-Up Around Your • Fleece Blanket • Toothbrush • Flip-Flops • Pillow Home… • Purse There Are Petroleum-Based Products Everywhere. Kitchen • Food • Trash Bags • Kitchen Utensils • Refrigerator Office • Ballpoint Pens • Cellphone • Computer • Keyboard • Window Frame Living Room • Couch • Television • TV Cabinet • Speakers Utility Room Garage • Appliances • Automobile, Fuel • Bug Spray • Bicycle Tires • Cleaning Products • Recycling Bin • Clothing, Shoes • Rope • Tool Rack AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Lower Energy Carbon Intensity – – – Increase  Improve  Embrace  Renewable  Energy  Innovation  Fuel  Efficiency  and Deploy  Processing  Advanced  and  Technologies  Energy Use  AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Putting Our Sustainable Energy to Work The 2030 target builds on our years-long commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations and products.

We have outlined a number of these initiatives in our 2019 Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios Report, available on our website, https://www.marathonpetroleum.com. We are committed to reassessing our GHG emissions goal as achievements toward GHG emissions intensity reductions are realized. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA -AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Embrace Innovation and Deploy Advanced Technologies – ADVANCED BIOFUEL Virent, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is working to commercialize its BioForming® process, which converts biobased feedstocks, such as sugars, into renewable fuel. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION 2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA – AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA — — — AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE 22AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Water Reuse and Recycling at Our Refineries Our refineries collectively saved hundreds of millions of gallons in municipal fresh water in 2019 through traditional approaches to water reuse, such as capturing steam condensate, as well as unique, site-specific recycling projects. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Biodiversity MPC and MPLX employ multiple proactive measures to protect plant and animal species and preserve their natural habitats. Our Operational Excellence Management System (OEMS), overseen by our Vice President of Environment, Safety and Security, provides the procedural framework to ensure we account for the potential effects of our activities on ecosystems and prepare necessary mitigation procedures. Our approach also involves ongoing collaboration with applicable state and federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Our pledge to preserve biodiversity extends to educating our employees and the communities where we operate, such as through our involvement in the Wildlife Habitat Council’s (WHC) land certification program. The WHC provides the only voluntary sustainability standard for biodiversity enhancement and conservation education activities on corporate lands. We own and manage more than 1,300 acres of WHC-certified habitat land at multiple locations, which support a variety of informational programs for students, community residents and employees. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Consideration of Biodiversity Impacts Our MPLX pipeline construction and maintenance projects require thorough evaluations of potential biodiversity impacts before commencing work. Our policies and practices for pipeline siting, construction and operation generally align with the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (Standards 1, 3, 4 and 6). For pipeline construction, we begin by determining the optimal route, considering these biodiversity impact factors: • Areas of high ecological consequence • Restrictions, such as known wildlife habitats, wetlands and archeological sites • Undeveloped, greenfield sites versus existing rights of way • Public lands, including parks, nature preserves and wildlife refuges • Waterways and floodplains For all activities involving disturbance to soils, we implement stormwater management controls to minimize the impact to lakes, rivers, streams and other bodies of water. Controls are implemented through the timely and informed application of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to foster compliance with federal, state and local stormwater pollution control requirements and in keeping with our commitment to environmental responsibility. BMPs cover preconstruction planning, temporary and permanent erosion control measures, and stream and wetland crossing processes. Construction also integrates environmental reviews, which include field studies to examine natural resources and land use within our proposed project footprints. Both new and maintenance projects near sensitive habitats can necessitate endangered species surveys. The results dictate project decisions, including the execution methods selected and whether to retain, remove or introduce vegetation to benefit any identified animal populations. To protect ecosystems from releases of materials, we implement comprehensive pollution prevention and incident response programs. In the event a release occurs, we take steps to mitigate the effects and develop corrective measures. See Pages 56 and 57 for a description of our emergency response capabilities. In Illinois, we voluntarily changed our technique for replacing a pipeline section that crossed a creek to prevent any harm to endangered Eastern Sand Darter fish. We originally received a permit to complete an open-trench cut of the creek to replace the pipeline. After learning this species was present, we worked proactively with the state to use horizontal directional drilling, allowing us to run the pipeline under the creek to avoid working in the water and impacting the fish. Along Missouri’s Gasconade River, we coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make certain our pipeline maintenance project did not adversely affect endangered mussels downstream of our project area. We voluntarily conducted a mussel survey prior to completing the maintenance activity, which confirmed no mussels were present in the project area. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Waste At MPC and MPLX, we seek to minimize waste generation, encourage recycling of the waste that is generated and appropriately dispose of the remaining waste. Prevention of pollution and resource conservation is a stated commitment in our corporate policies. Waste minimization is a business priority allowing for financial and environmental benefits to both the company and the communities we call home. Therefore, we continually look to improve our maintenance and operations activities to reduce the volume of waste generated. We carefully screen our vendors to ensure they meet our rigorous standards for recycled and disposed waste. This vetting program, including compliance with environmental laws and regulations, is called our Waste Management Vendor Approval Program. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Investing in Partnerships Waste to Fuel. MPC and Fulcrum Sierra Biofuels, LLC have partnered together to turn municipal waste into low-carbon transportation fuels, thereby converting 250,000 tons/year of waste into useable product. Fulcrum’s plant in Reno, Nevada will utilize a gasification process to turn sorted, municipal trash into a synthesis gas (syngas). The syngas will then enter a process to form a biocrude product that MPC plans to introduce into its refining process to produce low-carbon transportation fuel. In 2019, the refinery project team progressed a $14 million project to receive and process Fulcrum’s production of 800 barrels per day. In addition to the waste minimization advantages of this process, the low-carbon fuel produced will also avoid an estimated 69,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions per year compared to traditional fuel alternatives. In addition to our focus on reducing our overall waste to landfill, this initiative directly supports our goal to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels and comply with EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard and the California Air Resources Board’s low carbon fuel standard. 250,000 tons/year of municipal trash to be converted into low-carbon transportation fuel 69,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions to be eliminated per year compared to traditional fuel alternatives Waste to Cement. MPC and Circon Environmental continue to partner together to convert oil tank waste into cement, thereby reducing ash waste to landfills by 4,204 tons in 2019 and a total of 36,919 tons since 2014. The oil tank cleaning process produces a residual waste that can be used to fire kilns for the manufacturing of cement, a process that does not produce ash like traditional oil waste incineration. In addition, our oil waste that was burned in the kiln avoided an estimated 81,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions since 2014 compared to traditional cement kiln fuels. since 2014 we have avoided 36,900 tons of ash to landfills and 81,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) Catalyst Metals Reclamation. MPC and its strategic partner, AMG Vanadium (AMG), work together to improve the environment by minimizing waste and reducing GHG emissions. In 2019, in lieu of landfill disposal, MPC delivered 5,300 tons of spent catalyst to AMG. AMG extracted the vanadium and other valuable metals to produce ferrovanadium and a ferronickel molybdenum alloy, which are sold to the steel industry. This reclamation process produces 41,500 fewer metric tonnes of CO2e emissions than the traditional steel manufacturing process. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING WITH GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY INTEGRITY DATA Salt Lake City Refinery Low Sulfur Fuel In 2019, we completed a project at our Salt Lake City refinery to produce low-sulfur fuel. This low-sulfur fuel lowers tailpipe emissions by as much as 80% in the average new passenger vehicle.1 This project earned several awards, including: • Utah Manufacturers Association 2019 Manufacturer of the Year Award • Envision Utah’s 2019 Common Good Award • Recognition from Utah’s Office of Energy Development Terminals Fugitive Emissions We utilize optical imaging camera technology to scan our terminal equipment and make any necessary repairs to minimize emissions. As of Dec. 31, 2019, this voluntary program has been implemented at 84 MPLX terminals. Refinery Flaring Reduction We have reduced flaring at our refineries through our waste gas source reduction programs coupled with installation of flare gas recovery systems at 13 of our 16 refineries. Gas is returned to the refining process rather than flared, thereby reducing GHG emissions and criteria pollutants.

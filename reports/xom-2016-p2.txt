Managing climate change risks Climate change risk management strategy Society continues to face the dual challenge of meeting the world’s growing energy demand, while simultaneously addressing the risks of climate change. ExxonMobil believes the risks of climate change warrant thoughtful action. We are committed to providing affordable energy to support human progress while advancing effective solutions to address climate change. Our climate change risk management strategy includes four components: developing technology solutions, mitigating emissions in our operations, providing solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions for our customers and engaging on climate change policy. Developing technology solutions As society pursues energy solutions that will lower greenhouse gas emissions, technological advancements will be instrumental in providing the global economy with the energy it needs. Recognizing the challenges associated with most existing low greenhouse gas emissions energy technologies, particularly in delivering the necessary economy, scale and reliability, we are conducting fundamental research aimed at developing energy solutions that have the potential to be economically feasible without subsidies, standards or mandates. ExxonMobil is pioneering scientific research to discover innovative approaches to enhance existing — and develop next-generation — energy sources. ExxonMobil’s Emerging Technologies program brings together executives, scientists and engineers from across our businesses to identify and evaluate technology research opportunities with a long-term strategic focus. Our Emerging Technologies team seeks to understand a wide range of technology options and how they may shape the global energy system. Understanding the fundamental science serves as a basis for our broader research efforts and may lead to further technology development aimed at practical application. This awareness informs our internal analysis of the global energy landscape as reflected in our annual Outlook for Energy. The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040 At the center of our research is ExxonMobil’s Corporate Strategic Research laboratory, a fundamental research institution with approximately 150 Ph.D. scientists and engineers focused on addressing the company’s long-range science needs. Our in-house research portfolio includes a broad array of programs, including biofuels, carbon capture and storage, alternative energy and climate science. In addition to in-house research, we partner with leading universities around the world — such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, the University of “I believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it’s going to take all of us — business, governments and consumers — to make meaningful progress.” Darren Woods Chairman and CEO Texas and Stanford University — to broaden awareness of energy developments and support technology breakthroughs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency. Advanced biofuels ExxonMobil funds a broad portfolio of biofuels research programs, including ongoing efforts to develop algae-based biofuels. These include programs for converting non-food based feedstocks — such as whole cellulosic biomass, algae-based feedstocks and cellulose-derived sugars — into advanced transportation fuels. We believe that additional fundamental technology improvements and scientific breakthroughs are still necessary in both biomass optimization and the processing of biomass into fuels. Specifically, further progress is needed to ensure that advanced biofuels can work on a commercial scale and be produced with lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Our advanced biofuels research includes joint research collaborations with Synthetic Genomics Inc., Renewable Energy Group, the Colorado School of Mines, Michigan State University and the University of Wisconsin. For more information about our technology partnerships in 2016, see the Up Close on page 18. Energy investment in advanced biofuels ExxonMobil’s approach to developing future energy technology Carbon capture and storage Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process by which carbon dioxide (CO2) gas that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere is captured, compressed and injected into underground geologic formations for permanent storage. With a working interest in approximately one-quarter of the world’s total CCS capacity, ExxonMobil is a leader in one of the most important next-generation, low-carbon technologies. In 2016, we captured 6.3 million metric tons of CO2 for storage. We believe the greatest opportunity for future large-scale deployment of CCS will be in the natural gas-fired power generation sector. While CCS technology can be applied to coal-fired power generation, the cost to capture CO2 is about twice that of natural gas-fired power generation. In addition, because coal-fired power generation creates about twice as much CO2 per unit of electricity generated, the geological storage space required to sequester the CO2 produced from coal-fired generation is about twice that associated with gas-fired generation. ExxonMobil is conducting proprietary, fundamental research to develop breakthrough carbon capture technologies that have the potential to be commercially feasible without government subsidies, standards or mandates. Up Close: Next-generation technology partnerships ExxonMobil continues to invest in research and development of next-generation technologies. Achieving large-scale changes in the energy sector will require long-term investments in research to develop cost-effective solutions that are capable of broad commercial application. We conduct cutting-edge research and development in-house and in collaboration with other industries. We also partner with approximately 80 universities around the world to explore next-generation energy technologies. Spending approximately $1 billion per year on research and technology development over the past decade, ExxonMobil is maintaining a leading role in technological innovation in the energy industry. Below are examples of our technology partnerships announced in 2016. FuelCell Energy ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy, Inc., are pursuing a novel technology in power plant carbon dioxide capture through a new application of carbonate fuel cells. A fuel cell is a device that converts chemical energy into electricity. Advancing economic and sustainable technologies to capture carbon dioxide from large emitters such as power plants is an important part of ExxonMobil’s suite of research into lower-emission solutions to mitigate the risks of climate change. ExxonMobil researchers “The fuel cell carbon capture solution we are advancing with ExxonMobil could be a game-changer in affordably reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants globally. The carbonate fuel cell solution uses a proven global platform to generate power while capturing carbon dioxide.” Chip Bottone President and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy, Inc. conducted two years of comprehensive laboratory tests that demonstrated that the unique integration of two existing technologies — carbonate fuel cells and natural gas-fired power generation — allows the capture of carbon dioxide more efficiently than conventional technology. Through these tests, our scientists saw the potential for this exciting technology for use at natural gas-fired power plants to enhance the viability of carbon capture and storage while at the same time generating additional electricity. Following several years of experiments with FuelCell Energy, we advanced our research via a joint development agreement in 2016. This agreement allows scientists from both companies to work collaboratively to further develop this potentially game-changing technology. University of Texas ExxonMobil partnered with the University of Texas at Austin in 2016 to explore and progress innovative solutions to the world’s energy challenges. As part of this effort, we are investing $15 million in research initiatives over five years to build upon decades of research at the University of Texas and further develop existing and next-generation energy sources that have the potential to reduce emissions. The university’s renowned Energy Institute will help drive much of the research conducted through this partnership. Research projects are expected to cover a range of emerging “The University of Texas at Austin is proud and deeply appreciative of its long history of collaboration in education and research with ExxonMobil. This investment further unites two of the world’s leading energy organizations to pursue innovations for a better energy future.” Gregory L. Fenves President of the University of Texas technologies and will take advantage of the university’s capabilities in renewable energy, battery technologies and power grid modeling. Georgia Institute of Technology Research teams from ExxonMobil and the Georgia Institute of Technology have successfully developed a new method of reverse osmosis that filters hydrocarbons through synthetic carbon membranes at the molecular level. This is a critical step in the production of certain plastics that currently requires energy-intensive separation processes. Because the new method works at low temperatures, it may one day replace existing separation technology, dramatically reducing the amount of energy required in plastics processing. If brought to industrial scale, this breakthrough could reduce industry’s global annual carbon dioxide emissions by up to 45 million metric tons, which is equivalent to the annual energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of about 5 million U.S. homes. It could also reduce energy costs used to make plastics by up to $2 billion a year globally. Chemical plants account for about 8 percent of global energy demand and about 15 percent of the projected growth in Emissions reduction demand to 2040. As populations and living standards continue to rise around the world, the demand for auto parts, housing materials, medical devices, electronics and other products made from plastics and other petrochemicals will continue to grow. Improving industrial efficiency is part of ExxonMobil’s mission to meet the world’s growing need for energy while limiting environmental impacts. Renewable Energy Group ExxonMobil is a global leader in advanced biofuels research.  In 2016, we extended this leadership by partnering with Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG), to study the production of biodiesel by fermenting renewable cellulosic sugars from sources such as agricultural waste. This work is part of our many investments in new technologies with the potential to increase energy supplies, reduce emissions and improve operational efficiencies. REG has developed a patented technology that uses microbes to convert sugars to diesel in a one-step fermentation process similar to ethanol manufacturing. The ExxonMobil and REG research will focus on using sugars from non-food sources to produce biofuels. Through this research, we will address the challenge of how to ferment real-world renewable cellulosic sugars that contain impurities capable of inhibiting fermentation. The research will explore the technical feasibility and potential environmental benefits of biodiesel produced from fermented sugars. Positive results could lead to expanded efforts to explore scalability of the technology. “We look forward to this collaboration with ExxonMobil to advance our proprietary cellulosic sugar fermentation technology. This technology can enable us to capitalize on the combined power of cellulosic sugars and microbial fermentation to revolutionize the production of ultra-low carbon, cleaner-burning advanced biofuels.” Eric Bowen Vice president and head of REG Life Sciences Plastic possibilities What if you could meet the growing demand for certain plastics while reducing energy consumption and cutting carbon emissions? A potentially game-changing process may do just that. It’s called organic solvent reverse osmosis (OSRO). This breakthrough enables a building block of plastics (paraxylene) to be separated at the molecular level by using very little heat. If we used OSRO to help make certain plastics, it could: Cut annual energy costs by Reduce industry’s annual carbon emissions by Meet demand for plastics $2 BILLION 45 MILLION METRIC TONS RESPONSIBLY Mitigating emissions in our operations As we seek to increase production of oil and natural gas to meet growing global energy demand, we are committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions within our operations. ExxonMobil has a robust set of processes to improve efficiency, mitigate emissions and contribute to effective long-term solutions to manage climate change risks. These processes include, where appropriate, setting tailored objectives at the business, site and equipment levels, and then stewarding progress toward meeting those objectives. Based on decades of experience, ExxonMobil believes this rigorous bottom-up approach is a more effective and meaningful way to drive efficiency improvement and greenhouse gas emissions reduction than simply setting high-level corporate targets. We also believe that continuing to use this approach will yield further improvements in all sectors of our business. In the near term, we are working to increase energy efficiency while reducing flaring, venting and fugitive emissions in our operations. In the medium term, we are deploying proven technologies such as cogeneration and carbon capture and storage where technically and economically feasible. Longer term, we are conducting and supporting research to develop breakthrough technologies. Since 2000, ExxonMobil has spent approximately $8 billion to develop lower-emission energy solutions. In 2016, ExxonMobil’s net equity greenhouse gas emissions were 125 million CO2-equivalent metric tons. Relative to our 2015 performance, our 2016 emissions increased by approximately 3 million CO2-equivalent metric tons. This increase was primarily driven by new facilities in our Upstream operations, such as our Gorgon Jansz liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia. 2016 CDP response Energy efficiency In 2016, energy used in our operations totaled 1.5 billion gigajoules. Energy utilized in our operations generates more than 80 percent of our direct greenhouse gas emissions and is one of our largest operating costs. As such, we have focused on energy efficiency for many decades. Since 2000, we have used our Global Energy Management System in the Downstream and Chemical businesses, and our Production Operations Energy Management System in our Upstream businesses to identify and act on energy savings opportunities. Through our commitment to energy efficiency, application of structured processes and continued use of a bottom-up approach, we continue to yield industry-leading results. Greenhouse gas emissions (net)1 Net equity, CO2-equivalent emissions Millions of metric tons 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100110120130 2007 135 2008 126 2009 123 2010 126 2011 128 2012 126 2013 127 2014 123 2015 122 2016 125 Upstream Downstream Chemical In 2016, ExxonMobil’s net equity greenhouse gas emissions were 125 million CO2-equivalent metric tons. Relative to our 2015 performance, our 2016 emissions increased by approximately 3 million CO2-equivalent metric tons. 1Our calculations are based on the guidance provided in API’s Compendium of  Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry and IPIECA’s Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse   Gas Emissions. We report greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis for   our business operations, demonstrating a share of emissions from any facility oroperation in which ExxonMobil holds a financial interest, with the share reflecting the equity fractional interest. Greenhouse gas emissions (normalized) Net equity, CO2-equivalent emissions                                                 Metric tons per 100 metric tons of throughput or production 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 Upstream Downstream Chemical Our normalized greenhouse gas emissions from our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations totaled 24.5 metric tons per 100 metric tons of throughput or production in 2016. Over the past decade, increases in Upstream emissions have been largely offset by improvements in our Downstream and Chemical operations. We are committed to reducing our normalized greenhouse gas emissions through structured processes and the continued use of a bottom-up approach. Greenhouse gas emissions avoided from ExxonMobil actions2 Net equity, CO2-equivalent emissions Millions of metric tons 2.3 4.7 6.8 9.5 11.3 13.2 15.6 17.4 18.2 19.0 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Energy efficiency and cogeneration Flare/vent reduction In 2016, greenhouse gas emissions avoided from ExxonMobil actions were 19.0 million metric tons, cumulative since 2007. This represents an additional avoidance of 0.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions compared with our 2015 performance. 2Cumulative since 2006. For example, in the 2010, 2012 and 2014 Refining Industry Surveys, ExxonMobil’s global refining operations achieved first quartile energy efficiency performance.* Cogeneration Cogeneration technology captures waste heat generated from the production of electricity for use in production, refining and chemical processing operations. Due to its inherent energy efficiency, the use of cogeneration leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Our cogeneration facilities enable the avoidance of approximately 6 million metric tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions. We have interests in approximately 5,300 megawatts of cogeneration capacity in more than 100 installations around the world. This capacity is equivalent to the annual energy needed to power 2.5 million U.S. homes. Over the past decade, we have added more than 1,000 megawatts of cogeneration capacity and continue to develop additional investment opportunities. *The Solomon Survey provides a global benchmarking assessment of the refining industry and is conducted every two years. Results from the 2016 surveys are expected in mid-2017. Emissions reduction Flaring Flaring is the process of burning natural gas as an alternative to releasing the gases directly into the atmosphere. Flaring is done for safety reasons or because barriers to the development of gas markets and gas infrastructure prevent natural gas from being used. ExxonMobil is a charter member of the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, an initiative of the World Bank that seeks to reduce flaring by increasing the use of natural gas associated with oil production, by helping remove technical and regulatory barriers to flaring reduction, conducting research, disseminating best practices and developing regulatory country-specific gas flaring reduction programs. In addition, we put in place our own Upstream Flaring and Venting Reduction Environmental Standard for Projects in 2005. Our goal is to avoid routine flaring in new Upstream projects and to reduce “legacy” flaring in our existing operations. In 2016, flaring volume from our combined Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations totaled 5.0 million metric tons. This represents a decrease of 0.3 million metric tons compared with our 2015 performance. The decrease in flaring in 2016 was largely due to changes at our Usan field in Nigeria, where — since assuming operatorship in 2014 — we have implemented a program to eliminate routine flaring. Hydrocarbon flaring  Millions of metric tons  2007  8.0  2008  5.7  2009  4.4  2010  3.6  2011  4.1  2012  3.6  2013  3.7  2014  4.5  2015  5.3  2016  5.0  Upstream  Downstream  Chemical  In 2016, flaring volume from our combined Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations totaled 5.0 million metric tons.

Fugitive emissions occur when gases or vapors escape from pressurized equipment. We recognize the importance of reducing these emissions and continue implementing cost-effective methods to reduce methane and other hydrocarbon emissions in our operations. This includes structured leak detection and repair programs in which we use optical gas imaging cameras to identify leaks for prompt repair. Additionally, we continue to replace high-bleed pneumatic devices with lower-emission technology and conduct reduced emissions completions in our ongoing efforts to enhance the environmental performance of our operations. Our methane emissions in 2016 totaled 7 million CO2-equivalent metric tons, which is similar to our performance over the last several years. Most of our venting and fugitive emissions are methane, which represent approximately 6 percent of our direct greenhouse gas emissions. Providing solutions for customers Over the next few decades, population and income growth — and an unprecedented expansion of the global middle class — are expected to create new demands for energy and hydrocarbon-based products. Meeting these demands will not just require more energy, but will also require energy to be used more efficiently across all sectors. ExxonMobil is delivering solutions that enable our customers to reduce their emissions and improve their energy efficiency, including: • Expanding the supply of cleaner-burning natural gas to reduce emissions in power generation; • Creating highly efficient plastics and other chemical materials that can be applied in a range of consumer products; and • Developing premium, high-efficiency fuels and lubricants. Natural gas One of the greatest opportunities for society to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is through the use of natural gas in power generation. Natural gas is a flexible, abundant and low-emissions fuel that is available across the globe. On a life-cycle basis, from extraction through electricity consumption, using natural gas yields up to 60 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal. Natural gas is also the ideal partner for intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, as it can provide reliable power when these renewable sources are not available. We predict natural gas will be one of the most important energy sources to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. ExxonMobil is one of the largest natural gas producers in the world. Coupled with our leadership in the development of liquefied natural gas, we are well-positioned to meet growing demand for this cleaner-burning energy source. Chemical materials Materials developed by ExxonMobil provide manufacturers with quantifiable benefits in many consumer applications, including resilient, lightweight plastics that are used by automotive manufacturers to reduce vehicle weight and deliver greater efficiency for drivers. We have also developed advanced tire technologies that help maintain optimal tire pressure, improve rolling resistance and aid fuel efficiency, as around 25 percent of vehicle tires in the United States are underinflated. By addressing this issue, drivers could collectively save up to 1 billion gallons of gasoline per year. Additionally, our next-generation plastic packaging reduces total product weight and allows more products per shipment, fewer trucks on the road, less gasoline and energy used, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately less material to be reused, recovered or recycled. ExxonMobil plastic products also contribute to safety within the food industry. Plastic packaging is lightweight, durable and flexible, which makes it ideal for preserving food. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, one-third of the food produced in the world goes to waste each year. Plastic packaging can help reduce spoilage, increase access to food and improve food safety for consumers around the world. Fuels and lubricants ExxonMobil produces fuels and lubricants that deliver higher vehicle efficiency and lower emissions. In addition, we continue working on research and development of new fuels and lubricants. Our family of high-performance lubricants includes synthetic lubricants that have sustainable customer benefits, such as longer drain intervals than conventional mineral oils. Synthetic lubricants can be replaced with less frequency, therefore reducing the volume of used oil for disposal or recycle. In addition, extending lubrication service intervals increases efficiency and lowers maintenance costs while reducing potential risks from worker and machine interactions. There are also specific application advantages for these products, including in wind turbine applications where machinery is several hundreds of feet in the air. Mobil lubricants are used in more than 40,000 wind turbines worldwide. Engaging on climate change policy ExxonMobil believes the long-term objective of effective policy should be to reduce the risks of climate change at minimum societal cost, in balance with other priorities such as poverty eradication, education, health, security and affordable energy. Climate change is a global issue that requires the collaboration of governments, companies, consumers and other stakeholders to create worldwide solutions. We engage with stakeholders directly and through trade associations around the world to encourage sound policy solutions for addressing climate change risks. Effective climate change policies We believe that free markets, innovation and technology are essential in addressing the risks of climate change. Success in developing and deploying technologies will be highly dependent on governments creating a policy environment that enables innovation and competition. Policies should be clear and guard against duplicative, overlapping and conflicting regulations, which may distort markets and impose unnecessary costs on consumers. We believe that effective policies are those that: • Promote global participation; • Let market prices drive the selection of solutions; • Ensure a uniform and predictable cost of greenhouse gas emissions across the economy; • Minimize complexity and administrative costs; • Maximize transparency; and • Provide flexibility for future adjustments to react to developments in climate science and the economic impacts of climate change policies. Given the wide range of societal priorities and limited global resources, all policies should be as economically efficient as possible. ExxonMobil believes that market-based systems that place a uniform, predictable cost on greenhouse gas emissions are more effective policy options than mandates or standards. Market-based policies more effectively drive consumer behavior and technology innovation, while mandates and standards limit consumer choice and can perpetuate ineffective technologies. We recently joined the Climate Leadership Council as a founding member. The council advocates for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and aligns closely with our longstanding principles. Stakeholder engagement We engage a variety of stakeholders on climate change issues — including policymakers, investors, consumers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academics and the public to actively advocate for responsible policies that would be effective in addressing the risks of climate change. We offer data and policy analysis on proposals and engage in constructive debate. For example, we have had hundreds of meetings with policymakers around the world to share our views on carbon pricing policy. For additional information on ExxonMobil’s approach to political advocacy and contributions, see page 45. Our chairman and members of our management committee have primary responsibility for managing climate change risks for ExxonMobil and our operations. The board of directors receives annual in-depth briefings that cover updates on public policy, scientific and technical research, and company positions and actions related to climate change. To drive improvement, our merit-driven employee development and compensation systems integrate performance in environmental areas, including emissions and energy efficiency. As issues related to climate change arise at the local, state, national and regional levels, our global team of experts evaluates and develops a company position consistent with our principles. ExxonMobil employees also hold key leadership positions, including board of director positions, with many trade associations that engage on climate change issues, including the American Petroleum Institute (API), the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) and IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues. We believe an effective policy response to climate change requires a thorough understanding of the climate system. Our scientists have been involved in climate change research and related policy analysis for more than 30 years, resulting in hundreds of publicly available documents on climate-related topics, including more than 50 peer-reviewed publications. Peer-reviewed articles on climate research ExxonMobil experts have participated in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since its inception. Most recently, our scientists contributed to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report in lead author, review editor and reviewer roles. Our scientists also participated in the work of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, including its work to review the third U.S. National Climate Assessment Report and to provide advice to the U.S. Global Change Research Program. IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report Industry engagement ExxonMobil understands that stakeholders seek a better Up Close:understanding of the positions of the oil and gas industry, as well as how individual companies approach the management Outlook for Energy and business planningof climate change risks within their own businesses. As an active IPIECA member, ExxonMobil engaged with member companies in advance of the 2015 Conference of Parties (COP) 21 meeting in Paris to develop a common industry position on global efforts to address climate change risks. That work culminated in The Paris Puzzle — a publication on the challenges and responses the industry believes are needed to mitigate the risks of climate change. In advance of the 2016 COP 22 meeting in Marrakech, ExxonMobil further engaged with IPIECA members to explore solutions for transitioning to an energy system with lower greenhouse gas emissions. This work resulted in Exploring low-emissions pathways: Advancing the Paris Puzzle, which was published in November 2016. Exploring low-emissions pathways: Advancing the Paris Puzzle In 2015, we also took a key role collaborating with IPIECA and its member companies to create a voluntary reporting framework for oil and gas companies to publish their climate change risk management approach in a simple, straightforward and transparent manner. The resulting framework — which is currently being piloted by several IPIECA members, including ExxonMobil — covers a wide range of climate-related issues and provides a consistent reporting methodology for the oil and gas industry. This framework enables interested stakeholders to understand an individual company’s views on the issues central to addressing climate change risks. IPIECA Climate Change Reporting Framework Each year, we update our long-term energy demand projection in our Outlook for Energy, taking into account the most up-to-date demographic, economic, technological and climate policy information available. This analysis serves as a foundation for our long-term business strategies and investments, and is consistent with other credible forecasts such as the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) New Policies Scenario. Our Outlook reflects increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of pledges that were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related policies — which often target specific sectors — by using various assumptions and tools, including application of a proxy cost of carbon to estimate potential impacts on consumer demands. Key insights from The Outlook include: • From 2015 to 2040, global demand for energy is expected to increase by about 25 percent and will require all forms of energy; • Oil will remain the world’s primary fuel through 2040 due to transportation and petrochemical demand; • Natural gas will grow more than any other energy source, overtaking coal as the world’s second-largest energy source, due to power generation and industrial use; • Wind, solar and biofuels will average combined growth of about 5 percent per year — by 2040 these resources will comprise about 4 percent of global energy demand; • Conventional cars will remain most popular due to cost, functionality and increasing fuel efficiency through technology improvements. Decreasing battery costs are likely to enable small, shorter-range electric cars to account for approximately 10 percent of new car sales by 2040; and • Energy-related CO2 emissions will peak in the 2030s, then gradually decline. To enhance the robustness of our Outlook, we assess a wide range of assumptions for key supply-and-demand drivers to test the range of potential energy mix outcomes. Many third-party scenarios that represent a 2-degree Celsius pathway, including IEA’s 450 Scenario, show natural gas demand continuing to grow and oil continuing to play a prominent role in meeting the world’s energy demand through 2040. Even under the 450 and the New Policies scenarios, substantial upstream oil and gas investment of $11 trillion to $18 trillion will be needed through 2040 to meet global demand. While ExxonMobil currently contributes less than 3 percent of global production, we are well-positioned to support additional development required to meet demand as a result of our diverse resource base, superior project execution capabilities and industry-leading long-term returns on capital employed. We evaluate potential investments and projects using a wide range of economic conditions and commodity prices; we also financially stress test our investment opportunities, which provides an added margin against uncertainties and further enables us to consider various market environments and investment drivers in our planning and investment process. All business segments are required to include, where appropriate, an estimate of the costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions in their economics when seeking funding for capital investment. The Outlook for Energy Energy and carbon — managing the risks Global liquids supply Millions of oil-equivalent barrels per day (MOEBD) 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Source: Based on International Energy Agency sources, excluding biofuels. 3 Environmental performance Environmental management approach We conduct our business in a manner that is responsive to the environmental and economic needs of the communities in which we operate. ExxonMobil considers risks at every stage of development, and we continuously work to mitigate those risks and improve our environmental performance. We employ an environmental management strategy to monitor our performance in five key areas, as depicted on the right, which are discussed throughout this chapter. To describe our holistic approach to environmental management, we have ordered the topics discussed in this chapter to reflect the typical life cycle of our operations. Our approach requires our facilities to be designed, operated and managed with the goal of mitigating adverse environmental impacts. Our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) is a management framework that helps put our Corporate Environment Policy into action and establishes common worldwide expectations for addressing risks inherent in our business, including environmental risks. Our approach is grounded in a scientific understanding of the environmental impacts of our operations and a commitment to develop, maintain and operate projects and decommission assets using appropriate standards. For additional information on how ExxonMobil manages environmental performance, see the following resources: Environmental management Standards of Business Conduct Environmental Aspects Guide Biodiversity and ecosystem services Biodiversity refers to the number and variety of living organisms in a given area. Ecosystem services are the food, water, shelter, clean air and cultural identity that people obtain from the environment. Safeguarding the ability of the environment to support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services is a priority for ExxonMobil. Our approach to managing biodiversity and ecosystem services recognizes several factors, including the rarity of individual species, their roles in different ecosystems and habitats, their vulnerabilities and their cultural significance. To protect particular species and sensitive habitats, we take steps such as modifying engineering design, construction and operating practices, and enhancing wildlife habitats at our properties. ExxonMobil closely examines the environmental context of the areas where we operate to identify biodiversity and ecosystem services risks and appropriate protective measures. We also periodically screen the locations of our major operating facilities against databases of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and World Protected Areas. In 2016, an estimated 25 percent of our major operating facilities were within 5 kilometers of designated environmentally sensitive areas. By tracking these data, we are able to ensure prioritized areas receive special protection. Up Close: Environmental management across an asset life cycle We believe a comprehensive approach to environmental management includes a thorough assessment of potential environmental impacts. Based on these assessments, we then implement plans to avoid or reduce impacts across an asset’s life cycle. This approach is exemplified by environmental management activities at Imperial Oil’s Kearl operations in Alberta, Canada, where reducing the environmental footprint is incorporated throughout the asset life cycle. For example, the site takes advantage of electricity generated by energy-efficient cogeneration systems, an alternative dust treatment process to reduce water usage and wastewater treatment flocculation technology for accelerated tailings consolidation. Imperial Oil’s holistic environmental management strategy also includes progressive reclamation. As operational areas at Kearl are no longer needed, they are prioritized for reclamation to prevent erosion in the short term and to allow the land to return to its natural boreal forest state much earlier. Reclamation planners at Kearl aim to achieve a maintenance-free, self-sustaining landscape, which takes into account traditional knowledge, wildlife habitat and biodiversity. To date, more than 250 acres of land have been permanently reclaimed at Kearl. Muskeg Lake, which is connected to and adjacent to Kearl Lake, was designed to provide spawning, rearing, feeding and overwintering habitat for native fish species. Construction of Muskeg Lake commenced in 2008 and was completed in 2010. Lake filling was completed in 2013. This is the first of three lakes that will be constructed to replace the fish habitat disrupted as operations in the area progress. In 2016, Imperial Oil completed four years of fish and fish habitat monitoring at Muskeg Lake. Monitoring activities included sampling of fish populations to assess natural colonization and habitat productivity of the lake. Key findings indicate the population sizes and number of fish species has steadily increased from five species in 2014 to eight species in 2016. In addition to our commitment to protecting biodiversity in our operating areas, we support advocacy, research and partnerships to protect biodiversity outside our fence lines. In 2016, we contributed approximately $4 million to organizations, such as those focused on biodiversity protection and land conservation. Our Papua New Guinea biodiversity offset program, which provides a strategic roadmap for the sustainable use and management of the country’s biological resources, exemplifies our approach to managing biodiversity. For more information on the Papua New Guinea biodiversity offset program, see our biodiversity and ecosystem services webpage. Biodiversity and ecosystem services A plant found growing on trees high above the ground. This species is known to be found only in the Hides Ridge region of Papua New Guinea. Water management In 2016, the net freshwater consumption at our operations was 290 million cubic meters, a decrease of more than 3 percent from the 2015 consumption of 300 million cubic meters and a more than 9 percent decline since 2007. ExxonMobil works to manage our water use and to limit adverse impacts to water resources and consumers from our withdrawals and discharges, taking into consideration factors such as quality and availability. For example, when the Banyu Urip, Indonesia, operations required increased injection water volumes to maintain adequate reservoir pressure, we developed a large reservoir to capture and store excess water available in the wet season that would have otherwise not been used. Using the reservoir helped mitigate potential effects of our water usage on the local population during the drier months when water resources are scarcer. Using the latest version of the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues (IPIECA) global Global freshwater consumption1 Millions of cubic meters 2007 320 2008 350 2009 340 2010 330 2011 370 2012 330 2013 280 2014 270 2015 300 2016 290 ExxonMobil's global freshwater consumption in 2016 was 290 million cubic meters. This represents a 10 million cubic meter decrease when compared to our 2015 global freshwater consumption. Since 2012, we have actively maintained our freshwater consumption below our 2011 performance. 1We report freshwater intensity alongside consumption data in our performance data (pages 46-48). Freshwater intensity is the ratio of net freshwater consumption to the amount of throughput or production. Normalized in this way, we can better understand how efficiently we are using freshwater in our operations. Data collection began in 2007. Includes XTO Energy data beginning in 2011. ExxonMobil’s total freshwater consumption includes use by refineries and chemical plants, oil and gas production, and onshore shale resources development in the United States, principally onshore shale resources development. water tool, we identified that almost 35 percent of our major operating sites are located in areas with the potential for water scarcity. We pursue opportunities to reduce our water use and develop site-specific management strategies such as the deployment of water conservation technologies, the use of alternative freshwater sources, recycling of municipal and industrial wastewater, substitution with lower-quality water sources and harvesting of rainwater. Water management is an important aspect of hydraulic fracturing operations. Water use by basin differs due to geologic and reservoir characteristics and optimization of drilling and completion designs. For example, a Williston Basin well in North Dakota requires 6 million gallons for hydraulic fracturing, whereas a Permian Basin well in western Texas requires 15 million gallons of water. For information on how this water use compares to other forms of energy, see the infographic on our water management webpage. Water management Seismicity In some instances, due to unique geological conditions, oil and gas operations may trigger seismic activity. Such operations may include underground wastewater disposal injection, reservoir depletion and, in rare situations, hydraulic fracturing. We support risk management and mitigation approaches to seismicity that take into consideration the relative risks associated with the specific context and geography of the proposed operation. Mitigation methods include assessing factors such as fluid volume, formation character, tectonic setting, operating experience and local construction standards. At XTO Energy, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, we follow a disciplined injection well siting protocol prior to siting a disposal well using available data — including federal, state or internal seismic information — to conduct a risk assessment. ExxonMobil and Stanford University jointly developed a freely available software modeling tool assessing the potential risk of induced seismicity from industry saltwater disposal wells. Using data such as underground stress levels and reservoir parameters, the tool evaluates the potential for fault slip near disposal well locations. The tool is being used by regulatory agencies and energy companies to reduce the risk of induced earthquakes.

We are proud to report that, as a result of these efforts, we had fewer spills in 2016 compared with 2015. Over the past 10 years, ExxonMobil has reduced the global number of spills greater than 1 barrel by more than 13 percent.* We are continuously working to improve our ability to ensure a rapid and comprehensive response if a spill does occur. The total volume of hydrocarbons spilled on soil and water was 4,700 barrels in 2016, with more than 50 percent recovered at the spill sites. The majority of these spills did not affect third parties or the communities that surround our assets. For additional information on ExxonMobil’s emergency response capabilities, please see page 13. *This statistic is presented as an absolute number across ExxonMobil’s global operations. Because a significant portion of our Upstream operations are located offshore, we have developed specialized capabilities and tactics to improve offshore oil spill response and risk management. ExxonMobil has the industry’s only dedicated, in-house oil spill response research program, which includes a focus on cold water and remote locations, such as the Arctic. In 2016, we successfully stewarded completion of a field test of a full-scale prototype technology that uses nuclear magnetic resonance in the Earth’s field to remotely detect oil that might be trapped in ice. The technology is designed to detect the presence of oil to allow responders to monitor and more effectively respond to oil under ice. For information on ExxonMobil’s joint industry partnerships to enhance industry offshore spill response capability, visit the following resources: Spill performance Arctic oil spill response technology Air emissions In accordance with regulatory requirements and our commitment to maintaining operational excellence, we work to reduce air emissions associated with our operations and the products we deliver. ExxonMobil’s combined emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) have decreased by almost 40 percent over the past 10 years across all of our businesses. In 2016, our combined emissions totaled less than 0.4 million metric tons. For additional information on ExxonMobil’s air emissions, please see the performance data table on page 46. Decommissioning Throughout the life cycle of a producing oil field or other asset, we work to limit disruptions to local communities and protect the environment. Effectively decommissioning onshore and offshore assets is essential to reducing our overall environmental impact. We ensure that decommissioning activities are planned and conducted to appropriately manage risks and, where possible, create beneficial land use opportunities. Recognizing the unique challenges associated with offshore assets, ExxonMobil created an offshore decommissioning center of expertise in 2015 that is responsible for planning and managing the safe decommissioning of our offshore assets. Rehabilitation An important element of ExxonMobil’s decommissioning strategy is rehabilitation. This is the process of safely repurposing assets that are no longer productive resources. Whenever possible, we look for opportunities to repurpose former ExxonMobil sites for environmental and societal benefits. We support science-based, cost-effective approaches to remediation that take into consideration the interests of various stakeholders. We are committed to the sustainable stewardship of surplus properties. ExxonMobil Environmental Services (EMES) — our global organization that provides guidance and supports the remediation and stewardship of surplus sites — has managed more than $6.6 billion of remediation work and returned more than 2,300 property parcels to beneficial end uses since 2008. In 2016, EMES monitored 5,600 active sites in more than 30 countries. In 2016, EMES received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Region 4 Excellence in Site Reuse Award for our efforts to remediate and redevelop former Virginia Chemical Company (VCC) fertilizer manufacturing sites. VCC sites produced phosphate fertilizer from the late 1800s to the 1960s. While ExxonMobil never owned or operated the VCC sites, we became responsible as a corporate successor. In 2000, ExxonMobil and EPA Region 4 formed a collaborative  agreement known as the VCC Initiative to address the contamination at the properties where these facilities once operated. Since then, ExxonMobil has cleaned up 27 of the 30 former VCC sites, and worked with property owners and local communities to ensure the land can be redeveloped. Experimental fieldwork for engineered wetland research in Qatar to help improve water quality. Up Close: Advancing the use of engineered wetlands to treat industrial wastewater Over the past five years, ExxonMobil Research Qatar (EMRQ) has conducted extensive research to understand the feasibility of utilizing engineered wetlands to treat industrial wastewater for beneficial reuse in arid environments. Water quality characterization, influent and effluent water management and system maintenance are just a few of the important factors that need to be considered when designing such a system. In 2016, EMRQ commissioned a microbiology laboratory to study the functions and structure of microbial communities in wetlands to optimize wetland water treatment systems. EMRQ then completed a design for an experimental wetland to study the treatment of gas field-produced water to better understand the feasibility of using such systems for large-scale applications.

SunPower is pioneering new programs that not only help individuals obtain safe, affordable electricity, but also bring new jobs and revenue sources to underserved communities. Additionally, we are using these programs to educate young people about global energy needs while giving them the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills they’ll need to become tomorrow’s solar industry innovators. Educating the next generation of solar industry innovators SunPower HorizonsTM Program Since 2008, we’ve reached more than 15,000 students through our SunPower HorizonsTM program, our hands-on education program to prepare K–12 and college students for careers in the clean energy sector. All SunPower school district customers have free access to this program, the most substantive in the industry. In 2015 and 2016, we reached 6,000 students through the SunPower Horizons Program and doubled the number of Summer Solar Energy Academies, reaching 450 students through an intensive, week-long learning experience. EMPOWERING OUR COMMUNITIES Solar Suitcase Pilot In 2016, we completed a one-year pilot program with We Care Solar, which brought together SunPower employees, teachers and secondary students in Yolo County, Calif., to create We Share Solar® Suitcases. More than 250 students built a total of 60 solar suitcases, which will provide rural schools and underserved communities in the Philippines with safe and reliable electricity sources. Providing energy to those in need $28M SunPower contributes products and volunteer hours to GRID Alternatives, an organization that with SunPower support has provided 1,022 low-income families with an estimated $28 million in expected savings on electricity over 25 years. In the US: GRID Alternatives In 2016, SunPower announced a three-year extension of our partnership with GRID Alternatives, the nation’s largest nonprofit solar installer, to support their new Solar Futures education program for K-12 students. Our partnership has brought solar power to 1,022 families in need since 2006. With a combined 3.57 megawatts of solar installed, these families are expected to save $28 million over 25 years. In addition to donating SunPower products, we also donate our time— SunPower employees have volunteered 97,000 hours on installations since 2013. Through the partnership, GRID Alternatives has also provided solar installation training to more than 21,000 individuals. In the Philippines: Solar Service Station (3S) SunPower’s Solar Service Station (3S) pilot program brought safe, clean and affordable lighting to more than 1,000 impoverished residents of Smokey Mountain, a massive garbage site in Manila, Philippines. Residents go to the 3S units—portable, solar-powered structures—to rent rechargeable solar Watch the Video › lanterns for half the price of candles or kerosene lamps. Local partner organizations lead daily operations and maintenance, providing jobs and training for the community. 3S is modular, self-sustaining and easily scalable to other communities. SunPower won a 2015 Patents for Humanity award from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our contributions to the 3S project. One 3S storefront Smokey Mountain Rechargeable solar Smokey Mountain provides seven jobs, residents previously lanterns are 50% residents have more serves 300 families spent 35% of their cheaper than candles money for food, and positively impacts $1.00-3.00 daily or kerosene. necessities and more 1,000 people. earnings on candles hours to read, sew, and kerosene. study and work. Making solar more affordable for educators SunPower’s Product Discount Program enables universities and qualified organizations to purchase SunPower products at a significant discount for educational purposes and community-related projects. For example, this program served many teams from the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2015 Solar Decathlon. We reinvest these proceeds to strengthen the 3S and We Share Solar suitcase programs. Engaging SunPower employees in philanthropy SunPower encourages employees to give their time and money to the causes that matter to them. The SunPower Foundation offers dollar-for-dollar matching of employees’ donations to their favorite causes. In 2016, employee donations and SunPower matching funds together provided approximately $270,000 to 250 nonprofit organizations.

In 2016, SunPower employees volunteered more than 14,300 hours for 90 nonprofits, nearly doubling our corporate goal of 7,500 hours. Their work benefited official SunPower partners including GRID Alternatives and We Care Solar, as well as local community organizations such as food banks, children’s shelters and conservation groups. Protecting the environment isn’t always easy, but it’s well worth the effort. SunPower salutes all those working hard to build a brighter future—no matter the obstacles. We’re inspired by the perseverance and boundless optimism of others, and we remain committed to changing the way our world is powered. Visit sunpower.com/sustainability © 2017 SunPower Corporation.

Employment and Human Capital One of our greatest strengths is the diversity of our workforce, with men and women of many nationalities and backgrounds working together and sharing common objectives. Our culture of knowledge sharing and innovation ensures that we continue to meet the needs our stakeholders while developing our diverse workforce. We attract top performers from the countries where we work, and this broad range of perspectives enables us to better understand national issues, respond to local concerns, and deliver innovative products and services that meet the expectations and requirements of our stakeholders and customers. Research and Innovation Through a global network of Research and Engineering centers, Schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency, reduce E&P costs, improve productivity, maximize reserve recovery, and increase asset value while achieving these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner. In addition, these centers enable Schlumberger to explore new technology areas around the energy transition. Since 2008, our Corporate Venture group has supported external innovation by co-investing and codeveloping promising technologies with start-up companies in a broad range of disciplines, including technologies such as energy storage, nanocrystalline cellulose as a clean viscosifying agent, wireless power, high-pressure mass spectrometry, exoskeletons, automation and remote control, and cybersecurity—all of which are being actively pursued. More recently, we have invested in technologies around waste heat recovery and decarbonization, geothermal energy and heating, emissions monitoring and control, driverless vehicles and platooning for fuel savings, and renewable energy. Technology Watch, a component of our University Relations program, identifies opportunities for commercializing game-changing technology and connects the most promising university teams with the Schlumberger Corporate Ventures group and R&D organization. Some of the technologies currently being watched include drilling and treatment fluids that reduce our industry’s environmental footprint, the use of wellsite renewable energy, nanotechnology, autonomous vehicles, and the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to improve energy efficiency. We are one of the founding members of the NorTex Alliance of Petroleum Universities, which includes leading universities in Norway and Texas that are conducting applied research on carbon storage and reuse in operations to improve hydrocarbon recovery. As one of four founding companies that established the Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP) at Stanford University in 2002, today Schlumberger is one among 40 institutions worldwide that have collectively committed more than USD 188 million. We committed nearly USD 25 million to support the GCEP as it seeks new ways to supply energy to the world’s population while protecting the environment. The project manages a portfolio of energy research programs to develop technologies that are efficient, cost-effective on a large scale, and environmentally benign. The portfolio has led to the formation of several high-profile start-up companies. Schlumberger is proud of our meritocratic culture and commitment to early responsibility and internal promotion. We offer our employees a challenging work environment where they are treated fairly with equal access to opportunities. Our recruitment strategy is based on a long-term vision to enable us to hire the best talent across the world. We continually give trainees opportunities across different business areas and locations to accelerate their development. This also helps us develop an agile workforce and the next generation of business leaders.

Training is delivered through classroom-based instruction, live simulations at learning centers, self-paced learning using the latest interactive technologies, and on-the-job education. Development opportunities include coaching, mentoring, and cross training through career mobility to expose employees to new roles, geographies, business segments, and functions. Depending on job position, our employees participate in a variety of training modules. All employees prepare annual training and development plans with their managers and agree on specific actions for the year. Employees are also evaluated on “self.development” during their annual appraisal, which is part of our Commitment Mindset in the Schlumberger Blue Print in Action–Our Code of Conduct. Our goals are to foster partnerships between employees and the Company and create value for employees by enabling them to keep their skills current and develop their talents to their full potential. We also offer several internships for students, and many of our people started with Schlumberger this way. Interns generally progress through a period of intensive off-the-job technical training or receive on-the-job training interspersed with formal seminars. HSE Training HSE training continues to be a top priority at Schlumberger. For many topics, we use a learner-centered training approach that encourages active participation and incorporates a combination of micro-learning videos, group discussions, virtual reality, and role-play. Employees also have access to an online platform for interactive training that uses self-study and assessments to help them fulfill their required certifications. Throughout their careers, employees are assigned training, re-certification or refresher training based on their specific roles and responsibilities, work environment, geographic location, and activity risks. Employee Development As employees progress through different roles during their career at Schlumberger, they have the opportunity to develop their full potential through a combination of training and experience. For some positions, our goal is to transfer employees to a new role every two to three years. Our borderless career philosophy means we support flexible career paths, helping employees develop their skills across different functions, businesses, and geographies. Additionally, we provide employees with the necessary training to enable them to fulfill the requirements of their current role or position. Learning Centers Our global network of learning centers is busy year-round.

Making diversity a business priority has given us access to the best people, no matter where they were born. Schlumberger sees diversity of its workforce as an important part of its cultural philosophy and a business imperative because it enables the Company to serve customers anywhere in the world. We attract top performers from the countries where we work, and this broad range of perspectives enables us to better understand national issues, respond to local concerns, and deliver services that meet the unique expectations and requirements of our stakeholders and customers. National and Cultural Diversity One of our greatest strengths is the diversity of our workforce, with men and women of many nationalities and backgrounds working together and sharing common objectives. Schlumberger recruits and develops people in alignment with our business objectives and in proportion to the revenue derived from the countries in which we work. Our long-standing commitment to national and cultural diversity fosters a culture that is global in outlook yet local in practice, and this permeates every layer of the Company, including every level of management. Management Diversity Employees from non-Western countries and emerging countries are integrated into every level of our workforce, including senior management. Our Board of Directors also reflects the diversity of the Company. Three of our 10 directors are women. Among our directors, four are citizens of the United States; two are citizens of Russia; the others are citizens of either Norway, France, or Saudi Arabia; and one is a dual citizen of Argentina and the United Kingdom. Age Diversity Ongoing changes in the composition of our workforce require an adaptive approach toward recruitment, retention, and the mobility of our employees. When our senior professionals retire, it is important to capture their knowledge and pass it on. Schlumberger is dedicated to hiring, training, and retaining younger professionals to fill leadership roles when senior professionals retire, and we benefit from the perspectives younger employees bring to the Company.  Gender Diversity We strive to meet the evolving needs of our workforce in terms of gender equality, work-life balance, and dual-career expectations. We believe this focus helps us maintain our competitive edge. Schlumberger continually monitors compensation equality for men and women globally across all grades with the goal of maintaining equity. Our gender diversity focus began in 1994, when the Company set an overall target of having women comprise 15% of our workforce by 2015. When we achieved this milestone ahead of schedule in 2011, we set a new target of having women comprise 25% of our workforce at all levels of the organization by 2020. In 2018, women made up 16.3% of the Schlumberger workforce. Among our salaried population, 20% are women. As of December 31, 2018, women filled the following roles: two executives reporting to the CEO, one Product Line president, and one GeoMarket manager. Connecting Women Connect Women is an internal networking community that promotes gender equality and breaks stereotypes, empowering men and women to achieve their full potential.

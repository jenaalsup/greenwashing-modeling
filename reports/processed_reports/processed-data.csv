common method for estim society greenhous ga emiss are the ghg protocol and the lifecycl approach lca  each method ha value and to better understand the degre to which a compani is help reduc global emissions we see lca as a more use altern to the ghg protocol  below is a brief overview of each approach and the reason we view lca as prefer  ghg protocol the ghg protocol divid emiss into three categori or scope  scope  emiss are the direct result of an organization operations and scope  emiss come from the power gener by other that is use to run the oper  for instance scope  would cover the direct emiss from a factori in which a product is made and scope  would cover the emiss from the electr provid that power that factori  these are fairli straightforward to calcul and offer reason good insight into that company carbon emiss  we have report our scope  and  emiss for more than a decad  scope  however is more difficult to determin becaus it attempt to understand the full rang of indirect emiss from sourc not own or control by the manufactur  for instance the manufactur is requir under scope  to estim the carbon emit by the peopl or busi use it product  in addition scope  often result in doubl count of emiss becaus the same emiss are treat as scope  for the factori make the product and scope  for the compani use that same product  the assumpt both parti would have to make about each other activ make scope  overli complic and like inaccur  the ghg protocol is a valuabl tool to track progress on society collect effort to reduc total emiss  it insuffici for fulli assess an individu company progress in help reduc emiss while produc essenti good  thi is becaus the onli reason way to fulli assess a company progress is to understand the amount of carbon it emit rel to the product it produc and the altern to those product  thi is known as lifecycl carbon intensity and that insight is requir to engag in a reason comparison between compani or product alternatives regardless of a company rel size or what product it produc  the ghg protocol is an activitybas analysi and provid limit insight for a compani like our into how it might substanti lower it emissions short of shrinking discontinu operations or outright divest oper  a compani that reduc product will see it ghg protocolcalcul emiss decrease but activ doe not stop becaus society need have not chang  as a result if anoth compani fill the product void it may do so in way that are less effici and actual increas carbon emiss in the energi sector  if activ complet stops society need may go unfulfilled lead to shortag with result spike in price  the ghg protocol calcul wa not design to consid these import nuanc and as a result will reward an individu company behavior by show a reduct in a company greenhous ga level even when society emiss remain constant or perhaps rise  lifecycl approach lca on the other hand offer advantag not present in ghg protocol calcul  first that same manufactur may be engag in an effort to remov carbon through the applic of socal neg emiss  direct air captur is an exampl of these neg emissions becaus it remov carbon directli from the atmospher and store the carbon deep underground where it can have no advers effect on the climat  these technologies among others offer an increasingli import method for compani to reduc emiss and are essential in the view of experts if we are to arriv as a societi at net zero in the futur  for thi reason it is notabl that lca allow for consider of neg emiss when calcul a company carbon footprint  thi is the case becaus it is design to reflect a net emiss number  the ghg protocol calculation on the other hand doe not take neg emiss into account and onli provid gross emiss estim  if a compani were to reli onli on a ghg protocol analysis thi fact might advers affect it willing to invest in environment critic technolog like direct air captur  and process carbon biofe andelectrif captur recycl feed and storagpotenti decarbon action neg emiss technolog along a valu chain life cycl direct air naturebas captur solut e coal would be penal for meet society energi need in a way that is better than the altern  by contrast lca allow for a comparison of the rel emiss effici of differ form of energi by provid a view of lifecycl intensity of carbon emiss associ with meet a societ need  as mention above understand lifecycl intensity normal for compani size and the product it make  it also allow for a more accurate net emiss estim  in our realworld example natur ga emit up to  lower greenhous gase and produc significantli fewer air pollut than coal for power gener  lca provid the basi for thi comparison  the ghg protocol doe not  finally lca offer a view of the emiss intens of all aspect of a company valu chain  thi allow for likeforlik comparison within and across industri to understand who is do a better job of reduc second one of the critic question in consid fewer carbon emiss than coal  however under the best way to meet society need for energi is the ghg protocol the provid of natur ga would greenhous ga emiss while meet society the rel carbon burden associ with differ see their emiss calcul increas if they were need for variou product  in thi way energi product  for instance both natur ga and produc more natur ga to replac coal as a sourc one can ignor the size of a particular compani coal are use to gener electr and power heavi of energi  in other words the natur ga provider and look onli at how carboneffici it is  for industry but natur ga combust produc far though materi benefit the climat rel to instance the ghg protocol would tell you onli that exxonmobil is a veri larg produc of energi and products with a correspond emiss footprint  it would not however give you ani insight into how carboneffici it is when compar to other smaller compani in the same busi  for these reasons we do not set scope  target  we see the ghg protocol as a use tool for understand progress in reduc total emissions but it is not suit to understand and compar a company effort to reduc emiss associ with the servic and product it provid in meet society need  to meet a netzero goal it is essenti that compani fulli understand their net emiss and have a mean of compar themselv against other in their industri  most importantly the approach need to equip and incentiv compani to make invest that will reduc their emiss  not simpli encourag compani to back away from meet society need and pass portion of their carbon footprint to someon els  util an lca approach and appli it to exxonmobil busi plan through  we expect a  reduct in full lifecycl emiss intensity the result of which is expect to be an estim  reduct in full lifecycl absolut emiss  these are in comparison to  level  lca recogn the benefit of ccs hydrogen and biofuel for example under a lifecycl approach biofuels which are an altern to transport fuel made from crude oil have a significantli lower overal carbon intens  thi is becaus when the biomass that is use to make the biofuel is grown it remov carbon from the atmosphere which make the net carbon footprint of the biofuel lower than convent fuel  scope  under the ghg protocol methodolog doe not account for or reflect these neg emiss aspect of a company biofuel feedstock product  it treat the ultim biofuel no differ than fossil

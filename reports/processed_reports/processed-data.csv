energy, exxonmobil analysi energi product demand for convent fuel is expect to peak thi decad and then begin to decline, while demand for energy-dense, lower-emiss fuel is expect to grow rapidly, driven by hard-to-decarbon transport sector such as aviation, marine, and heavy-duti truck . more than 75% of our manufactur capac is co-loc in large, integr site that have the flexibl to shift product yield to best meet societyõ evolv need . as demand for convent road transport fuel declines, select asset can be repurpos to manufactur high-valu product includ chemicals, lubricants, and lower-emiss fuel . we continu to improv our portfolio, focus invest on those major asset in locat with sound comprehens carbon polici . our invest in north america, china, and singapor will help meet the grow demand for product with lower life-cycl emissions, and the flexibl of our site will allow us to chang as societyõ need evolv . chemic product global chemic demand is expect to grow faster than the global economy,13 driven by demand for product like cell phone and medic supplies, as well as product necessari to preserv food and improv hygien . demand for perform chemicals, includ our

cash flow and sharehold value, even in aggress emission-reduct scenario like the iea nze . our outlook for energy4 the outlook for energi is our latest view of energi demand and suppli through 2050 . it form the basi for our busi plan and is underpin by a deep understand of long-term fundament . in addit to assess trend in econom development, technolog advances, and consum behavior, the outlook seek to identifi potenti impact of climate-rel govern policies, which often target specif sector . to support a robust evaluation, our busi plan process annual updat assumpt by major region for crude

websit so that interest parti can see our key assumpt and conclus and the data and analysi behind them . outlook highlight energi and human develop are tightli link . between now and 2050, the world popul is expect to grow to almost 9 .7 billion from 7 .8 billion people, and global gross domest product (gdp) is expect to more than doubl . billion of peopl in develop economi are expect to see their incom grow, translat to more demand for electricity, as well as for homes, transportation, consum goods, and the energi to power them . importantly, mani across the globe will, dure thi period,

life-cycl approach (lca) . each method ha value, and to better understand the degre to which a compani is help reduc global emissions, we see lca as a more use altern to the ghg protocol . below is a brief overview of each approach and the reason we view lca as prefer . ghg protocol the ghg protocol divid emiss into three categori or òscope .ó scope 1 emiss are the direct result of an organizationõ operations, and scope 2 emiss come from the power gener by other that is use to run the oper . for instance, scope 1 would cover the direct emiss from a factori in which a product is made, and scope 2 would cover the emiss from the electr provid that power that factori . these are fairli straightforward to calcul and offer reason good insight into that companyõ carbon emiss . we have report our scope 1 and 2 emiss for more than a decad . scope 3, however, is more difficult to determin becaus it attempt to understand the full rang of indirect emiss from sourc not own or control by the manufactur . for instance, the manufactur is requir under scope 3 to estim the carbon emit by the peopl or busi use it product . in addition, scope 3 often result in doubl count of emiss becaus the same emiss are treat as scope 3 for the factori make the product and scope 1 for the compani use that same product . the assumpt both parti would have to make about each otherõ activ make scope 3 overli complic and like inaccur . the ghg protocol is a valuabl tool to track progress on society' collect effort to reduc total emiss . itõ insuffici for fulli assess an individu companyõ progress in help reduc emiss while produc essenti good . thi is becaus the onli reason way to fulli assess a companyõ progress is to understand the amount of carbon it emit rel to the product it produc and the altern to those product .49 thi is known as life-cycl carbon òintensity,ó and that insight is requir to engag in a reason comparison between compani or product alternatives, regardless of a companyõ rel size or what product it produc . the ghg protocol is an activity-bas analysi and provid limit insight for a compani like our into how it might substanti lower it emissions, short of shrinking, discontinu operations, or outright divest oper . a compani that reduc product will see it ghg protocol-calcul emiss decrease, but activ doe not stop becaus societyõ need have not chang . as a result, if anoth compani fill the product void, it may do so in way that are less effici and actual increas carbon emiss in the energi sector . if activ complet stops, societyõ need may go unfulfilled, lead to shortag with result spike in price . the ghg protocol calcul wa not design to consid these import nuanc and, as a result, will reward an individu companyõ behavior by show a reduct in a companyõ greenhous ga level even when societyô emiss remain constant or, perhaps, rise . life-cycl approach lca, on the other hand, offer advantag not present in ghg protocol calcul . first, that same manufactur may be engag in an effort to remov carbon through the applic of so-cal òneg emiss .ó direct air captur is an exampl of these neg emissions, becaus it remov carbon directli from the atmospher and store the carbon deep underground where it can have no advers effect on the climat .50 these technologies, among others, offer an increasingli import method for compani to reduc emiss and are essential, in the view of experts, if we are to arriv as a societi at net zero in the futur . for thi reason it is notabl that lca allow for consider of neg emiss when calcul a companyõ carbon footprint . thi is the case becaus it is design to reflect a ònetó emiss number . the ghg protocol calculation, on the other hand, doe not take neg emiss into account and onli provid ògrossó emiss estim . if a compani were to reli onli on a ghg protocol analysis, thi fact might advers affect it willing to invest in environment critic technolog like direct air captur . and process carbon biofe andelectrif captur recycl feed and storagpotenti decarbon action neg emiss technolog along a valu chainõ life cycl direct air nature-bas captur solut e coal, would be penal for meet societyõ energi need in a way that is better than the altern . by contrast, lca allow for a comparison of the rel emiss effici of differ form of energi by provid a view of life-cycl ""intensity"" of carbon emiss associ with meet a societ need . as mention above, understand life-cycl ""intensity"" normal for compani size and the product it make . it also allow for a more accurate, net emiss estim . in our real-world example, natur ga emit up to 60% lower greenhous gase and produc significantli fewer air pollut than coal for power gener . lca provid the basi for thi comparison . the ghg protocol doe not . finally, lca offer a view of the emiss intens of all aspect of a companyõ valu chain . thi allow for like-for-lik comparison within and across industri to understand who is do a better job of reduc second, one of the critic question in consid fewer carbon emiss than coal . however, under the best way to meet societyõ need for energi is the ghg protocol, the provid of natur ga would greenhous ga emiss while meet societyõ the rel carbon burden associ with differ see their emiss calcul increas if they were need for variou product . in thi way, energi product . for instance, both natur ga and produc more natur ga to replac coal as a sourc one can ignor the size of a particular compani coal are use to gener electr and power heavi of energi . in other words, the natur ga provider, and look onli at how carbon-effici it is . for industry, but natur ga combust produc far though materi benefit the climat rel to instance, the ghg protocol would tell you onli that exxonmobil is a veri larg produc of energi and products, with a correspond emiss footprint . it would not, however, give you ani insight into how carbon-effici it is when compar to other, smaller compani in the same busi . for these reasons, we do not set scope 3 target . we see the ghg protocol as a use tool for understand progress in reduc total emissions, but it is not suit to understand and compar a companyõ effort to reduc emiss associ with the servic and product it provid in meet societyõ need . to meet a net-zero goal, it is essenti that compani fulli understand their net emiss and have a mean of compar themselv against other in their industri . most importantly, the approach need to equip and incentiv compani to make invest that will reduc their emiss ð not simpli encourag compani to back away from meet societyõ need and pass portion of their carbon footprint to someon els . util an lca approach and appli it to exxonmobilõ busi plan through 2030, we expect a 6% reduct in full life-cycl emiss intensity, the result of which is expect to be an estim 18% reduct in full life-cycl absolut emiss . these are in comparison to 2016 level .51 lca recogn the benefit of ccs, hydrogen, and biofuel for example, under a life-cycl approach, biofuels, which are an altern to transport fuel made from crude oil, have a significantli lower overal carbon intens . thi is becaus when the biomass that is use to make the biofuel is grown, it remov carbon from the atmosphere, which make the net carbon footprint of the biofuel lower than convent fuel . scope 3 under the ghg protocol methodolog doe not account for or reflect these neg emiss aspect of a companyõ biofuel feedstock product . it treat the ultim biofuel no differ than fossil fuels, provid compani with no credit for, or incent to, produc these lower greenhous ga emiss product . potenti ghg benefit of exxonmobil product mta of ghg emiss avoid if all of exxonmobilõ project 2030 lng suppli to the market 120 substitut

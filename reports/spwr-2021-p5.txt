InnovationSunPower has established a reputation for innovation since its founding more than 37 years ago. Innovation underpins everything we do, from product development to financing to customer service. To achieve our mission of making solar and storage accessible to all Americans, we must pursue relentless growth and innovation at every level of our company.InnovationSunPower Financial™In December 2021, we launched SunPower Financial™, 
a financial services institution designed to make renewable energy affordable and accessible for more American homeowners. Additionally, SunPower Financial will expand access to underserved populations by supporting a new line of financial products with expanded eligibility. SunPower Financial will make it possible for homeowners to go solar with no down payment, lower monthly payments, higher credit limits and a faster application process. These offerings represent SunPower’s first steps toward its 25x25 commitments, which seek to increase access to solar and storage for residential customers who live in historically disadvantaged communities by 25% by 2025. SunPower is now the only solar company to offer a seamless solution for purchasing solar with storage, including design, sales, installation, warranty and financing. The benefits of solar should be available to all Americans, regardless of their zip code or income. By bringing financing in-house, we can lower the barrier of entry for U.S. consumers to own their home solar and storage system.Jason MacRaeExecutive Vice President,

By working together, these two leading clean energy companies make it easier and faster for consumers to switch to an electric lifestyle. SunPower is also the preferred solar and storage provider for Wallbox customers, as well as the preferred installer for EV chargers.Innovation—Wallbox EV ChargerVirtual Power PlantSunPower’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) solution makes it possible for SunVault™ energy storage customers to get paid for allowing their local utility to use stored energy during peak demand. SunPower’s VPP offerings help to contribute to a more stable power grid in local communities. The company’s first VPP offering, ConnectedSolutions, is available to qualifying customers served by Eversource and National Grid in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. SunPower passes through all grid payments directly to participants, who can earn hundreds of dollars per year in exchange for allowing the utility to discharge their battery during times of peak energy demand.Innovation—Virtual Power PlantEureka Grove CommunityDemonstrating the potential for comprehensive electrification in new home builds, SunPower partnered with the New Home Company to make solar systems, battery storage and at-home

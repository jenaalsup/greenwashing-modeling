MESSAGE FROM THE CEO Our company demonstrated strong operational performance and capital discipline in 2015 in the midst of weak oil market conditions. Our strategy in this “lower for longer” oil price environment is guided by three principles: preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our long-term growth options. Our mission is to be a trusted energy partner. We are committed to help meet the world’s growing energy needs in a safe, environmentally responsible, socially sensitive and profitable way. Sustainability practices are a fundamental part of our business strategy and operations – they create value for our shareholders and opportunities to continuously improve business performance. To fulfill our mission and commitment, Hess relies on a world-class workforce and a company culture that fosters excellence in operational, safety and environmental performance, professional growth, teamwork and corporate citizenship. Central to our culture are the Hess Values of Integrity, People, Performance, Value Creation, Social Responsibility and Independent Spirit. Through our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we translate these Values into sustainable practices that guide the way we do business as a trusted energy partner. Our 2015 Corporate Sustainability Report shows how sustainable business practices are integrated into our short-term goals and long-term strategy. Detailed information on our programs and performance are provided in this report and on our company website at hess.com. SAFETY Our first priority in driving sustainable performance is our comprehensive approach to personal and process safety. Regarding personal safety, our employees and contractors share a goal of reaching zero safety incidents – what we describe as “everyone, everywhere, home safe every day.” Hess’ workforce demonstrated outstanding safety performance in 2015. Our combined employee and contractor Lost Time Incident Rate was down 33 percent, and our Total Recordable Incident Rate decreased by 10 percent. We also measure another key performance indicator for safety – the rate of incidents with high potential severity or “HiPos.” Through a campaign focused on reducing dropped objects at our work locations, we achieved a 63 percent decrease in dropped object HiPo incidents, and an overall 43 percent reduction in our safety HiPo rate. Process safety is another key focus area. Effective process safety management at Hess has three components: understanding and addressing vulnerabilities that could impact the integrity of equipment and infrastructure, enhancing process safety leadership and increasing awareness of process safety across the company. Hess monitors and reports process safety key performance indicators using international standards. To further advance Hess’ journey toward zero safety incidents, we codified current and future safety initiatives into a five-year plan that will be reviewed and updated annually. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social responsibility is one of our key company values and fundamental to the way we do business at Hess. For us, part of being a trusted energy partner is making a positive impact on the communities where we operate. Hess’ approach is guided by our commitments to international voluntary initiatives designed to protect the environment, promote human rights and encourage financial transparency. In 2015 we continued our endorsement of commitments to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Global Compact, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We also enhanced our stakeholder engagement process by integrating stakeholder issues into our enterprise risk workshops, value assurance reviews and asset business plans. Hess’ strategic social investments are intended to make sustainable improvements to the quality of life in communities where we do business. In 2015, our social investment program totaled about $22 million, with more than $18 million directed toward education projects. The remainder was directed primarily to economic development, health and capacity building. CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT We see climate change as both an environmental and economic challenge that requires government and business leaders along with civil society to work together on a global scale. The International Energy Agency has projected that global energy demand will increase by 32 percent from 2013 to 2040, with 50 percent of the needed supply coming from oil and natural gas. To meet this long-term global demand for energy will require a comprehensive strategy that includes oil and natural gas as well as renewables for many years to come. Hess continues to take steps to monitor, measure and develop energy resources that the world needs in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. Between 2008 and 2015, we reduced our equity greenhouse gas emissions by more than 5 million tonnes through improved operating practices and asset closures and divestitures. We are committed to continuous improvement in this critical area and have set new intensity reduction targets for flaring and greenhouse gases that are described in this report. As a result of the abundant natural gas produced from U.S. shale, the U.S. carbon footprint has been reduced by about 10 percent since 2007 as cleaner burning natural gas has displaced coal use in electricity generation. U.S. shale energy also has boosted U.S. economic growth and employment and strengthened global energy security. Hess, as one of the largest producers in the Bakken play in North Dakota, has contributed to this success story and is committed to responsible shale energy development. To capture and monetize natural gas from our producing wells and minimize flaring, we have invested more than $1.9 billion in infrastructure in North Dakota. We also remain focused on reducing liquid spills and gas releases from our operations. We are continuously improving our containment practices and have taken a comprehensive approach to analyzing and addressing challenges in this area in 2015 in order to strengthen our operating and reporting practices. We continue to require our contractors to make non-proprietary data regarding the chemicals used in each hydraulically fractured well publicly available on the FracFocus website. PEOPLE We recognize that Hess’ continued success is driven by our dedicated employees, and we are committed to fostering a workplace that values diversity and inclusion, learning and development, employee engagement and talent enhancement. Our company has a special culture – shaped by the Hess Values – that distinguishes us. That culture is further enhanced by our adoption of Lean manufacturing principles, which foster teamwork and continuous improvement throughout our organization to overcome complex challenges, eliminate wasteful operational processes and create value. Overall, we are proud of the progress made in driving our company’s long-term sustainable performance and honored to have been recognized once again in 2015 for the quality of our environment, social and governance performance and disclosure. We recently completed a project to review and update our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) strategy to guide our efforts moving forward, which we believe will further enhance our operational effectiveness, reduce risk and strengthen our license to operate. Thank you to our employees, communities, customers, business partners and investors for their ongoing support and partnership. Together we will continue to build a sustainable enterprise that helps meet the world’s energy needs and makes a positive difference for our stakeholders and the world around us. Chief Executive Officer ABOUT HESS Hess Corporation is a leading global independent energy company engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. 2015 HIGHLIGHTS • In the Bakken shale oil play in North Dakota, net production averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) – a 35 percent increase from 2014. • In July 2015 we completed the sale of a 50 percent interest in our Bakken midstream business and formed a joint venture, with Hess retaining operational control. • North Malay Basin full field development progressed, with fabrication and installation of the central processing platform and commencement of development drilling. • In deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we advanced the Stampede project in preparation for development drilling in 2016. • In offshore Guyana, we participated in a significant oil discovery at the Stabroek Block. ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS Our 2015 direct economic contributions included payments to suppliers, capital  and exploration expenditures, wages and benefits, taxes and royalties, interest, dividends and social investments. $ Millions A portion of capital and exploration expenditures may include payments to suppliers. HESS PORTFOLIO OF OPERATIONS Developments  Exploration Production: Operated assets include the Bakken in North Dakota, the Utica in Ohio, Permian Basin in West Texas, Baldpate and Tubular Bells in the Gulf of Mexico, Okume and Ceiba in Equatorial Guinea, South Arne in Denmark and North Malay Basin in Malaysia.

REPORTING Within this report, we provide descriptions of the company’s 2015 strategy and performance regarding material economic, environmental and social issues. Our annual report, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K filing and proxy statement detail our financial and governance information; these documents can be found on our website. Additional sustainability and investor information is available at hess.com/investors REPORTING STANDARDS This sustainability report was prepared in accordance with the Core option of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and associated Oil and Gas Sector Supplement. The report is also based on the Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting document developed by IPIECA (the global oil and gas industry organization for environmental and social issues), the American Petroleum Institute and the International Oil and Gas Producers Association, as well as the 10 principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. A GRI Content Index, cross-referenced with IPIECA indicators and the UN Global Compact principles, is provided on pages 62-66. An expanded GRI Index is available at hess.com/gri-index MATERIALITY We prioritized new and emerging issues important to our stakeholders when developing the content for this sustainability report, consistent with GRI G4 materiality guidance. Engagement with our stakeholders – which include employees, suppliers, customers, communities, shareholders, governmental and non-governmental organizations, industry peers and academics – enables us to strengthen our license to operate and brings increased focus to our transparency goals. In 2015 we conducted a survey of select industry peers and a subset of priority external stakeholder groups to validate and expand upon our prior materiality assessments. We then supplemented the survey results with desktop research on a larger group of peers and stakeholders by reviewing public reports and websites documenting key issues for our industry. This process allowed us to validate that stakeholder expectations are being addressed. The material issues identified by the survey, which have informed our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) strategy and helped to define the boundaries of this report, are presented on pages 10-11. RESTATEMENTS We completed our transformation to an exploration and production company in 2014 after exiting our downstream business, which included refining, retail, energy marketing and energy trading. Historical safety and environmental data from 2013 and prior were restated to reflect the upstream (exploration and production) business only, with a few exceptions. For example, individual divestitures that did not meet the materiality threshold delineated in the Hess Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol for removal from our new 2014 GHG emissions baseline are included in the restated data. In addition, downstream-focused social investment spend, which represented less than 5 percent of the overall expenditure, was deemed immaterial for restatement purposes. Therefore, our historical social investment spend was not restated. We recently exited several international assets, including those in Algeria, the Canning Basin in Western Australia, China, France and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. In addition, we completed a decommissioning project at one of our assets in the United Kingdom in 2015. Data from these assets have not been excluded from the report, as the data were not deemed to be material. When conducting our annual internal review of performance data for this report, we built upon our typical review process and initiated a more detailed investigation of the performance data for 2015 and prior years. Based on this analysis, we have revised many of the historical environmental values stated in prior sustainability reports to improve the quality of our dataset. INTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE Our internal information systems promote the centralized collection of data from Hess-operated and joint venture assets around the world. In order to evaluate accuracy and reliability, we conduct quality assurance/ quality control reviews and validation of both aggregated and facility-level data. Individual numbers in the charts, tables and text may not precisely sum to the total amounts shown due to rounding. All currency found in this report is in U.S.dollars. EXTERNAL ASSURANCE This report has been assured by ERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS), a third party that annually reviews our sustainability data and self-declared GRI “in accordance” 2015 Corporate Sustainability Report option. This external review helps to ensure consistent and objective data collection and reporting of our sustainability performance. The Independent Assurance Statement is provided on page 67 of this report. ERM CVS’s assurance in years prior to 2014 included a review of downstream data, as well as current exploration and production activities. As a result, the prior years’ data that has been restated or revised has not been assured. In addition to providing assurance in relation to our sustainability report, ERM CVS also conducts a separate verification of the GHG emissions data provided in this report and in our CDP Climate Change response. BOUNDARY SETTING Included within the scope of this report are the principal facilities and assets operated by Hess Corporation and our subsidiaries during calendar year 2015, unless otherwise indicated. Data presented are gross figures from operated facilities, unless specified otherwise. We report some quantitative environment, health and safety data on a normalized basis to facilitate year-on-year comparisons. We report GHG emissions on both an operated and equity share basis in accordance with the GRI G4 Oil and Gas Sector Supplement and the IPIECA Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting GHG Emissions (2nd edition, May 2011). We also report our social investments for our operated assets, joint ventures and non-operated facilities in which we hold a significant interest. See our expanded performance data at hess.com/sustainability/performance.data/key-sustainability-metrics APPROACH TO REPORTING BOUNDARIES FOR MATERIAL ISSUES AND GRI G4 ISSUE MAP The 16 issues listed in the table below are those that both emerged as top issues from our materiality assessment survey and mapped to GRI G4 reporting criteria. The table provides a cross-reference with the relevant G4 categories for each issue and identifies the boundary for each issue in this report. Overall, our material issues include environmental, social and governance concerns, reflecting the diverse external stakeholder priorities and Hess’ operational and regulatory risk focus. Climate change, which has been a focus of our EHS & SR strategy to date, was one of the top five issues identified in our survey. *Identified as a top 10 issue in Hess’ 2015 materiality assessment survey. Note that “Community” and “Stakeholder Engagement” were identified separately in the top 10, but have been combined here. *Identified as a top 10 issue in Hess’ 2015 materiality assessment survey. Baldpate Platform, Gulf of Mexico HOW WE OPERATE We strive to meet the highest standards of corporate citizenship, contribute to the sustainability of the communities where we operate and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. The six core Hess Values support our aim to be the most trusted energy partner. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of Conduct), Social Responsibility Policy, Human Rights Policy, and Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy build on our Values to define internal expectations for sustainable management and performance at Hess. We apply these principles to key company processes and initiatives, as described in this section. GOVERNANCE AND KEY INITIATIVES The highest level of oversight at Hess rests with the Board of Directors, while direct responsibility lies with the company’s executive leadership. The EHS Subcommittee of the Board’s Audit Committee provides guidance to the Board on EHS-related considerations. Each member of the Subcommittee is independent and qualified under standards established by applicable law, stock exchange listing standards and Hess’ Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Subcommittee met four times in 2015. See Hess’ Corporate Governance Guidelines at hess.com/hessgovernanceguidelines The EHS Subcommittee is tasked with assisting the Board in identifying, evaluating and monitoring EHS risks and strategies with the potential to affect the people, environment or communities where we operate or our company’s business activities, performance and reputation. The Subcommittee also develops recommendations for the Audit Committee and the full Board on policies, programs and practices to address such issues and risks. Subcommittee members have extensive oil and gas industry experience, including operations, research and development, and financial expertise. Our Vice President of EHS meets regularly with the Subcommittee and the Chairman of the Board to prioritize any actions needed. Our company is governed by the Hess Executive Committee, which is composed of Hess’ most senior executives and chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Committee focuses on operational, strategic, financial, EHS and social issues, and is the highest approval body before the Board. While the Executive Committee meets face to face at least every other month, our Chief Operating Officer chairs an operational subcommittee of the Executive Committee that meets regularly to discuss these same matters. Hess’ Operational Excellence (OE) Council, composed of multidisciplinary senior leaders from across various business functions, aims to align and integrate enterprise-wide, high-impact initiatives that create high value for our company. The OE Council plays a role in determining the number of initiatives that will be undertaken each year and continually monitors and oversees the company’s progress in implementing these initiatives. It also helps to ensure that resources are available to achieve a successful outcome. The OE Council focuses on initiatives that create value through collaboration and predictable results, utilize a fit-for.purpose approach based on input from customers and use standardized methodology supported by tools and processes, all while leveraging global and local strengths. One key initiative sponsored by the OE Council in 2015 was our global standards project – with a particular focus on development of the Management of Change Standard (discussed in the Safety and Health section) and the Documents Standard, which will outline the minimum mandatory requirements for creating or revising controlled documents within Hess. responsibility (EHS & SR) strategy • Continue to develop and implement global standards on a prioritized basis • Approved four new environment, health and safety global standards • Further enhance our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and and completed gap assessments for six standards at selected assets Procedure through supporting reporting systems and continued rollout • Implemented our updated Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy of online anti-corruption compliance training and Procedure and deployed online anti-corruption compliance training • Strengthen use of regulatory assurance tools • Continued to enhance our contractor selection, management and review • Measure effective implementation of the EHS & SR strategy process • Expand reporting to meet growing stakeholder expectations HOW WE OPERATE EHS & SR Strategy Refresh We recently completed a project to review and update our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) strategy to fully align with our transition to an exploration and production company and our commitment to operating as a trusted energy partner. It is our expectation that refreshing our strategy will strengthen our license to operate, reduce risk and enhance both our operational effectiveness and our management of stakeholder expectations. The governance structure for the project (see table) included a project team composed primarily of subject matter experts and operational representatives. A steering committee of vice presidents from each of our major business functions provided guidance, expertise and strategic direction to the project team. The project was executed in four phases during 2015, as illustrated below. Each phase of the project was reviewed and approved by Hess executive leadership and the Board’s EHS Subcommittee. Governance Structure  Role  Board of Directors EHS Subcommittee   Oversaw and advised on    the strategy  Hess Executive Leadership Executive Committee, Operating Committee   Provided strategic direction    and approved the strategy  EHS & SR Strategy Steering Committee Operations, Enterprise Risk, EHS, SR, Government Affairs, Corporate Governance   Provided guidance and    assisted in developing the    strategy  EHS & SR Strategy Refresh Team Operations, Enterprise Risk, EHS, SR,  Government Affairs, Sustainability  Developed the strategy  The six priority areas in our EHS & SR strategy are: •Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas   (GHG) Emissions •Community and Stakeholder   Engagement • Human Rights and Security • Process Safety and Spills •Regulatory Assurance • Water Management Key elements of our EHS & SR strategy are summarized in the Progress and EHS & SR STRATEGY REFRESH PROCESS AND TIMELINE 1.

Strategic       Positioning Completed Q3 2015 Goals section, as well as referenced throughout this report. We plan to continue to check and adjust our strategy to align with changes to the social, political, economic and regulatory landscape. Global Standards Hess utilizes management systems as the framework for continuous improvement in managing risk, enhancing operational excellence, tracking key performance metrics and maintaining regulatory compliance. • Focused on six material issues   for strategy enhancement based   on stakeholder expectations and   risk to the company. • Determined Hess’ strengths    and identified areas for   improvement. In 2015 we continued our effort to develop and implement an enhanced framework of standards across the company. The goals of this project, which has been guided by the leadership of Hess’ OE Council, are to formalize enterprise-wide expectations and accountabilities and support a globally consistent approach to operational excellence. By documenting our expectations in the form of standards, we aim to strengthen the assurance process across the enterprise. Following a risk-based approach and our Documents Standard, we prioritized the order of development and implementation for enterprise-wide EHS standards. In 2015 we began implementing the first set of standards (i.e., Phase I), which were completed and approved early in the year: •Energy Isolation •Land Transportation • Lifting and Hoisting • Process Safety Information • Vehicle Entry •Waste Management The first part of implementation required our assets to complete desktop gap assessments to compare their current documented practices with the expectations of the newly issued standards and identify actions to close any gaps identified. In 2015 all assets included within the scope completed gap assessments on the Phase I standards and began implementation of, at a minimum, two of the standards based on asset risk and priority. The assets will continue implementing the remaining four standards through 2017. Phase II included the development of a second set of new standards by cross-asset and cross-functional teams. Phase II standards completed in 2015 and early 2016 included Confined Space Entry, Contractor Management, Dropped Objects and Emergency Preparedness and Response. An important aspect of this project has been the incorporation of Lean principles (see explanation of Lean concepts on pages 16-17). We began to establish a standardized work process in 2015 to gain efficiency, incorporate lessons learned and more easily track our progress throughout the project from the start of development through the implementation of each standard. To add clarity for all those involved in the effort and to mitigate inefficiencies, we created a series of support tools and guidance documents. To bring accountability to meeting deadlines and targets, we generated a series of metrics and charts to track the completion of gap assessments. The project will continue over the next few years, with the cross-functional and cross-asset teams developing Phase III standards, and the assets managing their plans and timelines for the implementation of each standard. Our current plan is to fully implement Phase I standards by the end of 2017, Phase II standards by the end of 2018 and Phase III standards by the end of 2019. KEY ENTERPRISE PROCESSES We apply a number of key processes in our organization that provide the foundation for managing risk and achieving operational excellence. We use these processes to evaluate investment opportunities and identify and mitigate risks in potential, new and existing operations. Enterprise Risk Management In keeping with our commitment to operational excellence, we apply a comprehensive, standardized approach to identifying and managing risks of all types across our operations. The Hess enterprise risk management (ERM) process is used to develop a holistic risk profile for each asset and major project, drawing input from subject matter experts, performance data, incident investigations, lessons learned and recent internal audits. Each risk profile identifies each risk and its associated likelihood as well as its potential impact to people, the environment or our business. Risks that are classified as critical, meaning they are more likely to occur and have a higher impact or that they are unlikely to occur but would have a significant impact, are placed on an integrated register that catalogs actions for management or mitigation. We completed risk assessments and risk registers for all assets and major projects in the Hess portfolio in 2015. These risk registers are reviewed and updated throughout the year as part of each asset’s and project’s operating rhythm. In 2015 we conducted the following ERM activities: • Advanced efforts to align the risk criteria and definitions used in EHS risk management practices with the ERM process, with plans to further formalize and document these processes in 2016 • Continued to work on embedding the ERM process into key business processes, such as project planning (value assurance) and new country entry • Furthered the integration of our ERM process with our stakeholder engagement program, including HOW WE OPERATE aligning key contacts at the asset level and facilitating stakeholder mapping at ERM workshops to enable effective stakeholder management Value Assurance Value assurance is a review process that Hess uses to properly characterize and assess our major investment opportunities, through internal reviews by those who are not directly involved with the asset or project. Following this process helps us ensure that our capital allocation and portfolio management decisions are based on independently reviewed, high-quality input. We review our assets and major capital projects as part of the appropriate business planning cycle to verify that they add value to our company and that the relevant technical expertise has been incorporated. Value assurance reviews focus on economics, subsurface and facility design, environmental and socioeconomic concerns, regulatory requirements and other non-technical risks. In 2016 we will begin to apply $20 per tonne and $40 per tonne carbon prices to the GHG emissions generated by new projects to evaluate the potential impact of carbon risk on project economics. VALUE ASSURANCE PROCESS The value assurance process is closely aligned with our ERM process so that we can apply consistent methodologies and criteria to risks across our company. New Country Entry Our new country entry process helps us to assess non-technical aboveground risks when evaluating opportunities in a new country of operation. Through this process, subject matter experts from various functions across Hess evaluate our future operations in a particular country through a detailed risk questionnaire that accounts for social, environment, legal, external affairs, compliance, commercial and supply chain risks. The purpose of the review, which draws on available information from governmental sources such as the U.S. State Department as well as leading non-governmental organizations such as the World Resources Institute, is to categorize each risk as high, medium or low based on severity and whether the risk can be easily mitigated. Through the new country entry process, we endeavor to enhance the quality and breadth of information available to Hess leadership for the evaluation of new opportunities. The process also helps the project team to mitigate identified risks once a commitment is made to enter a new country. Ultimately, we are able to support our ERM and value assurance workflows, utilizing the necessary information at key decision points in our investment and project planning processes. Lean We began our journey to adopt Lean principles throughout our organization in 2010, first applying them to the reduction of well costs and optimization of well productivity in our Bakken asset. Over the past several years we have successfully used Lean to eliminate waste, create value and drive reliability and continuous improvement for our communities, employees, business partners, shareholders and other stakeholders. At Hess, we view Lean not as a short-term program for achieving cost savings, but instead as a holistic cultural shift, changing the way we think and act in order to create value, improve performance and eliminate waste. Central to this shift has been moving our leaders from directing solutions toward coaching and developing our employees and contractors to generate solutions themselves. The result is a distinctive Lean culture in which continuous improvement comes from the entire workforce – or our “army of problem solvers.” Empowering our workforce has enabled us to find unique opportunities in both our onshore and offshore businesses to deliver better performance and safer operations. At our Bakken asset, for example, we have experienced a 64 percent improvement in drilling cycle time and a 62 percent reduction in drilling and completion well costs from 2011 to year-end 2015. Through the first quarter of 2016, we have reduced drilling and completions costs at our Utica asset by 75 percent and 50 percent, respectively, since we began to apply Lean in 2013. Most recently we introduced Lean techniques in our offshore operations. These efforts have contributed to a 40 percent reduction in lifting and hoisting incidents over two years, decreased turnaround time by 50 percent in Equatorial Guinea and achieved zero safety incidents and a significant reduction in construction time for our Stampede deepwater project in the Gulf of Mexico. We are embracing Lean as a business imperative, especially given the low price of oil, and a means to tap into the collective expertise and creativity of all our people to drive improvements in performance. Now we are accelerating the pace of engagement with our               suppliers, augmenting our “army of problem solvers” and achieving win-win benefits by saving time and money, eliminating waste and inefficiency and embracing innovation. For more on how our suppliers are achieving success through Lean, please see our case study on page 20. LEAN PRINCIPLES  Clear  Quality  Effective  Structured  Dashboards  Business  Operating  Problem  Plans  Rhythm  Solving  Standard Processes                                  Value Stream Management Leadership Behavior and People Development Well Delivery Excellence Hess’ vision for well delivery is to provide the best drilling and completions performance among our industry peers, with no major incidents. To achieve this goal we have been using a standardized process to execute wells across the enterprise since 2010. Our Well Delivery Excellence (WDX) framework enables us to consistently deliver wells that produce the highest value to the company by facilitating cross-functional collaboration, informed decision making and clear roles and responsibilities. The initial rollout of the WDX project management process in 2010 was highly successful. With the significant changes our company has experienced over the past several years, we recognized a need to refresh the WDX process to account for the different organization, portfolio and business environment. Our aim was not to overhaul the process, but to enhance it through the incorporation of Lean principles, the realization of additional capital efficiency gains and the incorporation of lessons learned since initial rollout. We initiated the refresh effort in late 2014. Following approval by Hess executive leadership, we began rollout of the enhanced process across the organization in early 2016. The WDX process, which is designed to be flexible and scalable to accommodate the full range of well projects in the Hess portfolio, involves five phases: • Scope – Well concept options and opportunities (including an initial assessment of potential value, risk and technical complexity) are identified • Design – Final well design is selected, and the resources required to execute the project are refined • Plan – Detailed well design and technical specifications and a detailed operations plan for well or program execution are developed •Operate – The well operation is executed with the goal of safely delivering the well or program objectives •  Closeout – Handover documentation is completed, performance is reviewed against the plan and final lessons learned are captured and shared

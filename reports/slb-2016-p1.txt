This is Schlumberger Many of the advanced technologies we offer our customers are directly helping them decrease their environmental impact while optimizing the recovery of nonrenewable resources. In our 2016 Global Stewardship Report, we document many of the ways in which combining our technology with increased engagement in the communities where we live and work is reducing environmental impact, adding value, and building capacity at the local level.      ENVIRONMENT      COMMUNITY      TRACK RECORD ChairmanÕs Message ChairmanÕs Message Global Stewardship of the environment and the communities in which we live and work is an essential part of what Schlumberger does every day in more than 85 countries. Optimizing water use, ensuring well integrity, and reducing emissions are integral to the guiding principles that define the way in which Schlumberger provides services that optimize reservoir recovery and production. Our approach to Global Stewardship seeks to minimize the impact our operations have on the environment. Even though 2016 was an extremely challenging year for our industry, we advanced our Global Stewardship activities by launching programs to reduce energy consumption. For example, our Mission Emission program helped us reduce our combined carbon dioxide emissions in 2016 by 27,000 tonnes compared with 2015. Our position as the leading oilfield services company stems from more than 90 years of experience in the science of measurement, developing the technology our customers need to optimize their performance. This domain expertise also uniquely equips us to develop innovative technologies that can address environmental issues, such as biodiversity. One example is eSourceª, the world's first bandwidth controlled seismic source developed to limit the exposure of marine wildlife to high-frequency sound waves in the vicinity of seismic operations. In tandem with technology development, we have implemented new ways of working throughout the Company, which has enabled positive results for our social responsibility activities. For example, our supply chain efforts around the globe help economies expand their business opportunities by assisting them to build capacity and resilience at the local level. Furthermore, our commitment to diversity is supported by the goal to have women comprise 25% of our workforce by 2020. Our workforce is our most valuable asset and the reason why Schlumberger is committed to maintaining the highest safety and health standards for our employees, customers, and contractors. At the community level, our goal is to have a positive long-term impact through a number of outreach initiatives, such as Schlumberger Excellence in Education Development, health, safety, and environment (HSE) for Youth, and Faculty for the Future. These initiatives are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development goal of ensuring quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. Our lengthy history of engagement in the countries where we operate enables us to make a positive impact in local communities. Sometimes this impact includes special operations, such as mobilizing resources for disaster relief when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Ecuador in April 2016. While Schlumberger employees around the globe donated to a disaster relief fund, our employees in Ecuador helped relief efforts by constructing water wells and delivering food, supplies, water, and medicine to those in need. Schlumberger seeks to be a unifying force for social and environmental stewardship in the communities where we and our customers live and work. This approach combines better ways of working with innovative technology and local initiatives to reduce the environmental footprint of the oil and gas industry. It is also an approach that takes the long view by continuing to find ways to improve our performance so Schlumberger can help preserve the worldÕs natural resources for future generations. Paal Kibsgaard Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ChairmanÕs Message100,000 Approximate Number of Employees Worldwide 140+ 85+ Countries Nationalities Founded in 1926, Schlumberger is the worldÕs leading provider of technology for reservoir characterization, drilling, production, and processing to the oil and gas industry.

We strive to maintain the trust and confidence of our customers and stockholders as well as everyone affected by our operations. When we behave in an ethical manner, we enhance our reputation for integrity, which in turn helps us attract and retain both customers and employees. Corporate governance is the bedrock of our Global Stewardship, including environmental, economic, and social responsibility in the communities where we live and work. Our board members are, without exception, fully committed to doing what is right for Schlumberger and for the communities where we operate. Corporate GovernanceCorporate Governance Board of Directors The Schlumberger Limited Board of Directors consists of 12 members, including one executive director and 11 independent directors. Our director independence standards exceed the independence requirements in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Nominating & Governance Committee of the Board evaluates the suitability of potential nominees for Board membership, taking into consideration the Board's current composition including relevant industry or other expertise; gender, cultural, and geographical diversity; and the general qualifications of potential nominees. Structure The Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine an appropriate board leadership structure to ensure independent oversight of management. The Board believes that there is no single, generally accepted board leadership structure that is appropriate across all circumstances, and that the right structure may vary as circumstances change. As such, the Board's independent directors consider the BoardÕs leadership structure annually, and may modify this structure from time to time to best address the CompanyÕs unique circumstances and advance the best interests of all stockholders, when and as appropriate. Most recently, the independent members of the Board determined to combine the positions of Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. However, the independent directors of the Board may, at their discretion, separate those roles in the future if they deem such action appropriate. Diversity With approximately 100,000 employees who represent over 140 nationalities, Schlumberger and our Board of Directors value gender, cultural, and geographic diversity in our directors as well. Three of our 12 directors are women. Among our directors, four are citizens of the United States, three are citizens of Norway, and we have one citizen from each of the following countries: Argentina, Canada, France, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. Our diverse Board also evidences the BoardÕs commitment to have directors who represent countries where Schlumberger operates. The Nominating & Governance CommitteeÕs evaluation of director nominees takes into account a directorÕs ability to contribute to the BoardÕs diversity, and the Nominating & Governance Committee annually reviews its effectiveness in balancing these considerations in the context of its consideration of director nominees. Diversified Director Tenure 3 4Ð7 Years 5 4 > 7 Years 0Ð3 Years Schlumberger adheres to sound principles of corporate governance, and our practices promote the effective functioning of our Board of Directors and our Company. Board of Directors1 È Peter L.S.

The Audit Committee assists in oversight of financial statements as well as legal and regulatory compliance and independent auditor performance. The Compensation Committee helps the Board discharge its responsibilities with regard to executive compensation. The Nominating & Governance Committee identifies and recommends individuals qualified to become directors, oversees the Ethics and Compliance Program, and conducts the annual review of the BoardÕs performance. The Finance Committee assists with financing policies along with pension and profit-sharing trusts. The Science and Technology Committee advises the Board and management on matters involving the CompanyÕs research and development programs. The preceding descriptions are qualified by reference to the committee charters, which can be found at: Audit Committee Compensation Committee Nominating & Governance Committee Finance Committee Science and Technology Committee Communication with the Board The Schlumberger Board of Directors and individual members can be contacted at the following address: Schlumberger Board of Directors or name of Board member c/o the Secretary Schlumberger Limited 5599 San Felipe, 17th Floor Houston, Texas 77056 Executive Compensation Our compensation program is designed so that the higher an executiveÕs position in the Company, the larger the proportion of compensation that is contingent on long-term stock price performance, the CompanyÕs financial performance and individual performance, described as Òat-riskÓ compensation. The Company believes that having a significant portion of executive compensation at-risk more closely aligns the interests of its executives with the long-term interests of Schlumberger and its stockholders. Accordingly, our executive officers receive a greater percentage of their compensation through at-risk pay tied to Company performance than our other executives. A more detailed discussion of our executive compensation program is available in our 2017 proxy statement starting on page 26. The Compensation Committee believes that: ¥ The pay of our named executive officers and other senior executives should be strongly linked to performance that is evaluated against personal and Company financial goals. ¥ Our compensation program should enable us to recruit, develop, motivate and retain top global talent, both in the short-term and long-term, by establishing compensation that is competitive and by promoting the CompanyÕs values of people, technology and profit. ¥ Long-term incentive equity awards should encourage the creation of long-term stockholder value, align our executivesÕ compensation with the stock price returns of our stockholders, and incentivize our executives to achieve strategic and financial goals that support our long-term performance and leadership position in our industry. ¥ Our executives should be required to hold stock acquired through equity-based awards and stock ownership guidelines that align their interests with those of our other stockholders. Promotion from within the Company is a key principle at Schlumberger, and all of the named executive officers have reached their current positions through career development with the Company. Schlumberger sees diversity of its workforce as an important part of its cultural philosophy and a business imperative. We believe that our consistent approach to compensation at all levels, irrespective of nationality, is a strong factor in achieving a diverse workforce comprised of top global talent. For more information: Financial Performance2 (Stated in millions, except per-share amounts) 2016 2015 2014 Revenue  $ 27,810  $ 35,475  $ 48,580  Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Schlumberger  $ (1,687)  $ 2,072  $ 5,643  Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations  $  (1.24)  $ 1.63  $ 4.31  Cash dividends per share  $ 2.00  $ 2.00  $ 1.60  Cash flow from operations  $ 6,261  $ 8,805  $ 11,195  http://investorcenter.slb.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=97513&p=irol.reportsannual Independent Audit PwC auditors reviewed our processes and procedures for 2016 and verified a subset of our data.

This means understanding what defines us as a company, recognizing how we behave toward others, and defining how we approach our work. The Blue Print documentsÑOur Identity and Our Code of ConductÑare designed to help employees accomplish this. These documents summarize a number of elements that include Our Purpose, Ambitions, and Values, and they express the mindset we need to succeed. The Schlumberger Blue Print in ActionÐOur Code of Conduct applies to all Schlumberger directors, officers, and employees of the Company. It is designed to help each employee handle business situations professionally and fairly. It explains how our actions reflect on the Company, and how the Company is, therefore, the sum of our actions. Employees are the first line of defense in protecting the Company against incidents of non-compliance. Ethics and Compliance (E&C) training is designed to provide targeted training to employees throughout their careers in Schlumberger, focusing on the E&C risks encountered in their various roles in the Company. Employees are required to complete E&C-related training on a regular basis, and as their careers progress. The E&C training requirements are periodically adjusted to ensure employees continue to receive proper E&C training. Our Mindset summarizes the behavior expected of every Schlumberger team member, including attitude, words and actions, as we interact with each other and with our external stakeholders. Commitment Integrity Understand and support Recognize the boundaries the direction ahead. and have the courage to act Make a difference. honestly and responsibly. Do the right thing.

Achieve excellence. Help the team succeed. È Creativity È Collaboration È Initiative È Communication È Adaptability È Coaching and mentoring È Results focus È Diversity EthicsBusiness Ethics Acting ethically involves more than simply ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. It involves recognition that our decisions affect others. By keeping this in mind, we earn the respect, trust, and confidence of our customers, colleagues, shareholders, and others affected by our operations. By doing things right the first time, every time, we enhance our reputation for integrity with these stakeholders (Code of Conduct, p. 11). Supply Chain Management Schlumberger works with suppliers in a socially responsible and ethical manner. We have zero tolerance for corruption of any kind, and we expect the same from our contractors and suppliers. To meet our industry requirements, suppliers must adhere to responsible social, environmental, and economic practices. Our suppliers are selected and retained in alignment with our health, safety, and environmental stewardship standards and Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct, p. 12). Employee Whistle Blower Protection Employees who believe that a violation of Our Code of Conduct has occurred must report concerns to management using any available channel of communication. Schlumberger will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who raises a concern in good faith. Employees are required to report known and suspected violations of the Code of Conduct and applicable national laws. However, employees who intentionally report false information are subject to disciplinary action (Code of Conduct, pp. 1 and 12). Conflicts of Interest Conflicts between personal interests and the interests of Schlumberger or its customers may arise when personal, social, financial, political, or other interests interfere. To avoid such conflicts of interest, employees must not hold financial stakes in companies that do business with Schlumberger. They must put Schlumberger business interests first, disclose all conflicts of interest, and avoid situations that create the appearance of a conflict of interest. If such a conflict exists, the affected employee must obtain written approval from an appropriate Schlumberger controller before continuing to work (Code of Conduct, p. 16). Stock Transactions Our Insider Trading Standard prohibits employees from releasing material, non-public information about such things as financial results, changes in dividends and earnings, mergers and acquisitions, and business strategies. Employees are required to keep such information confidential, including all nonpublic and insider information that relates to Schlumberger or its financial position. Also, employees may not buy or sell Schlumberger Limited stock or publicly traded options until the information becomes public, nor can they act to acquire or sell stocks and options of companies with which Schlumberger does business until the information is public knowledge (Code of Conduct, p. 17). Gifts and Entertainment Accepting or giving business gifts or hospitality must never influence business decisions. Items or benefits for which the recipient does not pay fair market value, including meals, entertainment, or tickets to sporting events worth more than a nominal value cannot be offered to or accepted from any individual or organization that wishes to do business with Schlumberger (Code of Conduct, p. 19). Antibribery No employee may offer or accept bribes in any form or under any circumstance, including bribes related to charitable contributions. We avoid facilitation payments, making them only in very limited circumstances, such as when an individual's health or safety is at risk and only when we have obtained proper approval and documentation according to Schlumberger requirements. In addition, payments to government officials are forbidden. Schlumberger is politically neutral and does not make political contributions (Code of Conduct, p. 23). Blue Print in Action The Blue Print in Action reinforces the Blue PrintÐOur Identity, which summarizes our purpose, ambitions, values and the mindset we need to succeed. The Schlumberger Blue Print in ActionÐOur Code of Conduct is reviewed periodically and amended as appropriate. In Brief All Schlumberger employees, contractors, and third parties must: È know and obey the laws where the Company operates È not engage in actions unless they are ethical and legal È ask questions and raise concerns when issues arise È report actual or potential violations internally ENVIRONMENT      COMMUNITY      TRACK RECORD Ethics Fair and Ethical Business Practices Schlumberger does not win business or maintain customer relationships by acting illegally or unethically. We do not enter into agreements that can restrict full and fair competition. We do not share pricing or bidding information with competitors, or with anyone outside of the Company. We do not use Company funds or assets for political purposes. We may engage in dialogue with public policy decision makers, but we do not use lobbyists or seek to bring about particular outcomes or decisions. We compete aggressively, but fairly (Code of Conduct, p. 26). Trade Compliance Schlumberger provides products and services in many countries worldwide. Virtually all of the countries in which we operate have customs laws, and many have additional trade controls that govern the import, temporary import, export or re-export of Schlumberger products, services, technology, and software. Wherever we do business, we comply with all trade control laws and regulations that apply to us, and we are especially mindful of technology transfers (Code of Conduct, p. 30). Business and Financial Transparency Schlumberger keeps honest and accurate business records. Employees must not hide, alter, falsify or disguise the true nature of any business transaction. Schlumberger complies with accounting and financial reporting standards, and requires employees to follow internal financial approval guidelines. We retain and destroy business records in accordance with local laws and with Schlumberger requirements (Code of Conduct, p. 36). Conflict Minerals Schlumberger recognizes that human rights abuses can exist in the extraction, transportation, and trade of minerals in some countries. We commit to not knowingly contribute to the conflict through our sourcing activity. Schlumberger does not tolerate corruption of any kind, and we expect our suppliers to adhere to the same standard. We have also developed a supplementary Conflict Minerals Policy. Information Protection Information Security Schlumberger is committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of any employee or third-party personal information that it processes. Specific internal data privacy requirements guide the collection, use, transfer (including transfer across international boundaries), release, disclosure and security of such data. These requirements also describe our expectations for third parties who process such data on our behalf (Code of Conduct, p. 31). Consumer Data Protection Information is the foundation of our business. Confidential or commercially sensitive information comes in many forms, including via conversations, on paper, and electronically. We treat all electronic records created or transmitted using Company tools as Company property, and we take every available measure to preserve the confidentiality of Schlumberger and customer data (Code of Conduct, p. 34). Intellectual Property Rights Protection Intellectual property that is created when an employee makes a new discovery or conceives of an idea, device, technique or process related to our business becomes the exclusive property of Schlumberger. All employees agree to this concept as a condition of employment. The Company protects its intellectual property and confidential information by using non-disclosure agreements and confidential disclosure agreements before giving third parties access to such information. We also comply with restrictions on the installation and use of third-party software (Code of Conduct, p. 36). EthicsSocial Responsibility Equal Opportunity-No Discrimination One of our greatest strengths is the diversity of our workforce. Employees of many nationalities and backgrounds work together to achieve common objectives. As a global company, we encourage fair employment practices and offer equal opportunities to all our employees (Code of Conduct, p. 27). Fair Wages Compensation paid to workers must comply with all applicable wage laws, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours, and benefits. The basis on which workers are being paid is clearly conveyed to them in a timely manner. We offer competitive compensation and benefits packages, and we require our suppliers to comply with all applicable wage laws wherever we work (Code of Conduct, p. 27, and internal personnel policy). Human Rights Schlumberger employees represent more than 140 nationalities, and they live and work in approximately 85 countries around the globe. Our employees are expected to treat one another professionally and with mutual respect. As well, suppliers must not engage in discrimination based on race, color, gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, religion, union membership, or marital status. Schlumberger endorses the aspirations of the International Bill of Human Rights which includes Child Labor (Article 25); Discrimination (Article 7); Fair Wage and Collective Bargaining (Article 23); Freedom of Association (Article 20); Human Rights (Articles 1&2); and Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking (Article 4) (Code of Conduct, p. 27, and Supply Chain Services). Immigration and Employment Laws Because our business involves frequent international movement of employees, we ensure that the travel, transfer, employment, and residence of all personnel complies with applicable immigration and employment laws. This requirement extends to dependents of our employees and contractor personnel. Schlumberger has visa and immigration compliance programs to assist in this effort, but we expect all employees to take responsibility for their own immigration status (Code of Conduct, p. 30). Child Labor Hiring children is strictly prohibited. A child laborer is defined as any working person who is, (1) under the age of 15, (2) under the age for completing compulsory education, or (3) under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is youngest (internal personnel policy). Social Responsibility We contribute to the social development of our communities by supporting initiatives that improve youth education and living conditions. We foster the economic development of these communities by recruiting, hiring, and training where we work, promoting from within and by complying with national regulations and rules. We actively promote health and education in these communities (Code of Conduct, p. 27). Social and Environmental Management Standard A standard to manage social and environmental issues, risks, and impacts in large-footprint projects has been applied on eight projects where Schlumberger develops and comanages customer oilfield assets under long-term commercial agreements. Aligned with IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, the Schlumberger Social and Environmental Management Standard provides a framework for managing our local impact and ensuring that we respect the rights of individuals and groups in the communities where we work and live. The standard provides specific guidance in six social and six environmental subject areas. Environmental Responsibility Operations Integrity Operations integrity means that every employee commits to doing the job right the first time, every time. We do this to protect our people, our communities, the environment, and to deliver flawless quality to our customers. To help make continuous quality improvements, we participate in all required audits and periodic assessments. We also help improve quality by addressing customer feedback in a timely and appropriate manner (Code of Conduct, p. 14). Protecting the Environment Our advanced technologies enable our customers to lower their environmental impact while optimizing the recovery of nonrenewable resources. By combining our technology advantage with increased engagement in the communities where we work, we are lowering emissions, decreasing water usage, and reducing unplanned releases. Addressing Climate Change As a global technology leader, we believe that our ability to address climate change issues with innovative new technologies and increased operational performance is integral to the energy industryÕs global initiative to reduce carbon footprint. Schlumberger technologies are already directly and indirectly helping our customers reduce or avoid emissions, lower water usage, improve chemistry applications, and increase oil and gas production using fewer resources. Our corporate strategy includes the development of advanced technologies for faster drilling, reduced surface and subsurface footprint, and improved reservoir recovery and production, all of which contribute to lowering resource requirements and creating fewer emissions per hydrocarbon unit produced. Environmental Management Our HSE management system has encompassed environmental quality management for more than 15 years. This system has been independently reviewed for conformance to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System standard, and for conformance to environmental standards of the International Finance Corporation.

Environmental MetricsIn addition to manufacturing PV modules with the lowest environmental impact in the industry, First Solar is committed to reducing the company’s operational impact. Since 2009, we’ve successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water, waste, and carbon intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput and capacity utilization.Since announcing our vision for Series 6 in late 2016, we have achieved significant progress in our manufacturing and technology roadmaps. During 2019, we commenced commercial production of Series 6 at expanded manufacturing facilities in both the U.S. and Vietnam. The addition of these factories increased our global Series 6 production capacity to 5.5GW at the end of 2019. We produced 5.7 GWDC of Series 4 and Series 6 modules in 2019, which represented a 111% increase from 2018. The increase in our production capacity and throughput, along with the incorporation of resource efficiency measures into new buildings and Series 6 tool designs and processes, helped significantly reduce our GHG emissions-, energy-, water- and waste intensity in 2019. We have received global recognition for our state-of-the art environmental controls, performance and manufacturing excellence. Both of our facilities in Perrysburg have received the Ohio EPA’s Encouraging Environmental Excellence Gold Level Award. In March 2020, First Solar Malaysia received the prestigious State Environmental Excellence Award from the Kedah Department of Environment in recognition of our leadership and continuous efforts to demonstrate full environmental compliance in our manufacturing operations.  First Solar’s Santa Clara and San Francisco offices received the Green Business Program certification for efforts to ensure that our business operates in an environmentally friendly manner. First Solar had no environmental non-compliance cases in 2019.Environmental Metrics  |  13GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INTENSITY GOAL2008 Baseline246250200150100500Scope 1 + 2 Emissions Intensity

Since 2008, our company-wide carbon intensity decreased by approximately 66% as a result of increased module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, and capacity utilization, decreased emissions intensity of purchased grid electricity, 
along with energy conservation and low carbon initiatives. We have installed onsite PV installations at our production sites in Ohio and Malaysia and at our recycling facility in Frankfurt Oder, Germany.We achieved our 2021 goal three years early and plan to set a new GHG emissions intensity goal. In 2019 alone, our GHG emissions intensity decreased by nearly 40% as a result of the efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process and the incorporation of energy efficiency measures into new buildings, tool designs and processes. Although our production more than doubled in 2019, our absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions increased by only 30% compared to 2018. First Solar received an A- from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in recognition of the company’s disclosure and management of its climate change risks and greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.In 2020, we joined RE100 and committed to powering our global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2028. By relying on long-term, fixed-price renewable energy, we are not only investing in reducing our exposure to energy price volatility, but we’re also investing in a sustainable energy future.The chart depicts direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2) emissions of all manufacturing and recycling plants, 
R&D and testing facilities, EPC-owned construction equipment, company-owned operational solar projects, and company-owned vehicle fleet on a carbon intensity basis measured per MW produced.MANUFACTURING ENERGY INTENSITY 0.400.300.200.100.00kWh per Watt2009 Baseline0.340.250.230.220.162017201820192016In 2019, our manufacturing energy intensity (energy consumption per watt produced) decreased by 36% compared to 2018 primarily due to the increased throughput and efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process. First Solar’s manufacturing energy intensity includes all processes, from the beginning of our manufacturing process to finished module. Increased manufacturing throughput combined with module efficiency improvements and energy conservation initiatives enabled us to cut our manufacturing energy intensity in half over the last decade.MANUFACTURING WATER INTENSITY2009 Baseline1.92.001.601.200.800.400.00Liters per Watt1.251.231.060.682017201920162018Since 2009, First Solar’s manufacturing water intensity (water consumption per watt produced) decreased by 64% due to significant improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, and the implementation of water conservation and recycling projects in our manufacturing and recycling operations. Since 2018, all routinely operated First Solar recycling facilities in the U.S., Germany, Malaysia and Vietnam generate zero wastewater discharge under normal operations. Instead, the wastewater is recycled and converted into freshwater, which can then be reused in the recycling process. In 2019, First Solar’s manufacturing water intensity decreased by approximately 46% due to the increased throughput and efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as water recycling initiatives. While our production more than doubled in 2019, our absolute water withdrawals only increased by approximately 13%. In total, we saved approximately 300 million liters of water in 2019, equivalent to approximately 8% of our absolute water use. We monitor and measure 100% of the water discharges from our manufacturing, recycling, and research and development facilities. In 2019, approximately 49% (or 1,902 megaliters) of First Solar’s total water withdrawn from water utilities (3,846 megaliters) was discharged as wastewater from our industrial wastewater treatment systems. Approximately 44% of our wastewater was sent to a third-party (municipal wastewater facility) and approximately 56% was discharged directly to fresh surface water (river). First Solar treats wastewater at its manufacturing and recycling facilities using a batch discharge system. Once treated, the water is collected in holding tanks, which are sampled and tested to confirm compliance with regulatory limits before being discharged. No industrial wastewater leaves our site unless we have tested and approved it for discharge, even if it is being discharged to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. If the water contaminant levels are above the permitted discharge limit, it is sent for re-treatment internally. MANUFACTURING WASTE INTENSITY4035302520151050Grams per Watt2009 Baseline35.19.79.18.67.32016201720182019First Solar’s manufacturing waste generation intensity (grams per watt produced) has decreased by nearly 80% since 2009 as a result of increased module and manufacturing efficiency combined with recycling and waste minimization projects. In 2019, our manufacturing waste intensity decreased by approximately 15% primarily due to increased manufacturing throughput related to our Series 6 production lines.WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSALRecycled HazardousRecycled Non-HazardousDisposed Non-HazardousDisposed Hazardous4530150Million Kilograms41.5117%28.2217%7%23.295%22.079%5%7%21%8%5%10%4%61%79%80%65%2016201820192017This graph depicts First Solar’s absolute manufacturing waste produced in kilograms (kg) with a percentage breakdown by type and destination. Overall waste generation increased in 2018 and 2019 with the addition of our manufacturing facilities in Vietnam and Ohio. Waste generation in 2019 increased by approximately 80% due to the 111% increase in production compared to 2018.First Solar is committed to reducing and recycling hazardous waste in line with our environmental management system objectives of minimizing waste and preventing pollution. Since 2012, we have reduced our hazardous waste generation per watt produced by more than 50%. Hazardous waste is classified according to the definition used by the countries in which we operate, e.g. under the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations in Malaysia, Law No. 55/2014/QH13 on Environmental Protection in Vietnam, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the U.S.MANUFACTURING WASTE RECYCLED VS.

The data includes modules that we recycle onsite; both manufacturing line scrap and modules returned from the field, along with many other manufacturing byproducts that are recycled. The data does not include modules that are being recycled at our recycling facility in Germany. The amount of waste disposed increased in 2018 and 2019 due to the decommissioning of Series 4 manufacturing equipment and the ramp in production. Overall, of the total material First Solar sends off-site, more than 60% is sent for beneficial reuse and not to landfill. The percentage of waste recycled has steadily improved in 2020 since increasing our recycling capacity and moving to 24/7 recycling. 2019 RECYCLING AND RECOVERY ACHIEVEMENTThe material recovery rate of First Solar’s state-of-the-art module recycling process remains unchanged. We continue to recover more than 90% of the semiconductor material and 90% of the glass from a First Solar module. The glass cullet is reused in new glass products and the unrefined semiconductor material is sent for further processing to be reused in new First Solar modules. In Malaysia, our laminate material is being recycled for reuse in products such as rubber mats, bicycle handles, and shoe soles, thereby further closing the loop on our product’s life cycle. The following table includes data from our recycling facilities in Ohio, Malaysia, Vietnam and Germany.Metric Unit Global Total collected Metric tons 30,146 Total recycled - metals (not including semiconductor materials) % 0.2 Total recycled - semiconductor materials % 0.4 Total recycled - glass % 90 Total recycled - other materials % 5 Total disposed - sent to a thermal with energy recovery facility % 1 Total disposed - sent to a thermal or landfill facility for disposal % 3 Recycling material recovery rate* % >90 Percentage products or components prepared for reuse**  % 0 *Recycling rate is the quotient of Total recycled and Total collected.  Because 2019 was a transition year with the ramping of Series 6 technology, the recycling rate is a reported as a range rather than a discrete value. **Refers to products or components that are used again for the same purpose for which they were conceived without any pre-processing, e.g. refurbishment.

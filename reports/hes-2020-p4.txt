Carbon Asset Risk Assessment To help quantify climate related risks and opportunities Ð and to provide perspectives to our investors and other key stakeholders on how HessÕ oil and gas portfolio might be impacted by a transition to a lower carbon economy Ð Hess conducts an annual scenario planning exercise as a methodology to assess portfolio resilience over the longer term. This scenario based approach allows us to assess and communicate to our shareholders our understanding of future risks and opportunities in relation to the potential evolution of energy demand, energy mix, the emergence of new technologies, and possible changes by policymakers with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. Because the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommends transparency around key parameters, assumptions and analytical choices, Hess has chosen to model the two key scenarios detailed in the International Energy Agency's (IEA's) 2020 World Energy Outlook (WEO) against our own internal base planning case. The TCFD recommends that organizations use a scenario under which global warming is kept to well below a 2¡C increase, compared with preindustrial levels, to test portfolio resilience. Such scenarios usually feature a reduction in demand for oil, natural gas and coal, and a growth in clean technologies. The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) in the IEAÕs 2020 WEO, which is part of HessÕ modeling, fits with this recommendation. Considerations for Carbon Risk Scenario Assessment To evaluate the potential exposure of our portfolio in a carbon constrained future, we began by considering the long range outlook for energy supply and demand, as well as for oil, gas and carbon prices. We have used the IEAÕs 2020 WEO to examine supply and demand and oil, gas and carbon price scenarios through 2040 in the Stated Policy Scenario (STEPS) and the SDS (see iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020). These scenarios are recognized as a leading industry standard and benchmark worldwide and are, therefore, an appropriate choice for an oil and gas producer such as Hess. Our assessment of carbon risk is based on these scenarios, which are premised on a long term view of energy supply and demand. For its 2020 scenarios, the IEA has noted that there are minimal short term impacts on energy supply and demand related to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In the IEAÕs SDS, the emphasis on strong early action and the subsequent rapid reduction in emissions is fully aligned and internally consistent with the Paris AgreementÕs objective to hold temperature rise to well below 2¡C. The SDS is also consistent with universal access to modern energy by 2030 (United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goal 7, target 7.2) and net zero emissions by 2070. We have not modeled the WEOÕs newly introduced 2050 Net Zero Emissions Scenario, which is more aggressive than the SDS in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, on the basis that the IEA does not provide sufficient public data in the form of oil and natural gas demand, energy price and portfolio impact information to conduct the appropriate modeling. The pair of charts below depicts the 2020 WEOÕs world energy demand and CO2 emissions under the IEAÕs two key scenarios. World Primary Energy Demand by Fuel, and Energy Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, by IEA Scenario Billion Tons of Oil Equivalent20  Stated Policy Scenario  Sustainable Development Scenario  40  15  30  10   20  5  10  0 2000  2018  2025  2040  2000  2018  2025  0 2040  ÷ CO2 equivalent ÷ Other Renewables ÷ Nuclear ÷ Natural Gas  ÷ Bioenergy ÷ Hydrogen ÷ Oil ÷ Coal  Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide The IEA 2020 World Energy OutlookÕs Two Key Scenarios ¥ The STEPS takes into account implementing measures affecting energy markets that have been adopted (chiefly the Nationally Determined Contributions Ð the emissions reductions agreed to by individual countries under the Paris Agreement), together with relevant policy proposals, even though specific measures necessary to put them into effect may need to be fully developed. The 2020 World Energy Outlook makes a case-by-case judgment of the extent to which policy proposals will be implemented. ¥ The SDS reflects a pathway to achieving key energy related components of the U.N. Sustainable Development Agenda Ð including universal access to modern energy by 2030, urgent action to tackle climate change and measures to improve poor air quality. The SDS is fully aligned with the Paris Agreement and is designed to achieve net zero emissions by 2070. If emissions were to remain at zero from 2070, the SDS provides a 50% probability of limiting the increase in global average temperature rise to 1.65¡C in 2100; if negative emissions technologies were to be deployed after 2070, the temperature rise in 2100 could be limited to 1.5¡C with a 50% probability. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY Carbon Asset Risk Assessment, continued In STEPS, which is consistent with enacted energy policies and a Global Oil Demand by IEA Scenario and Declines in Oil Supply from 2019pragmatic view of proposed policies, worldwide energy use is 120Million Barrels of Oil per Day expected to grow by approximately 20% between 2019 and 2040. While there is a decline in demand for coal in this scenario between 2019 and 2040, oil and natural gas are expected to grow by 7% and 29%, respectively, and account for 54% of the energy mix in 2040, up by 1% from the prior yearÕs STEPS. In the SDS, worldwide energy use is projected to experience a moderate decline of 10% between 2019 and 2040. While oil and natural gas demand is projected to decrease by 24% in 2040, 100 80 60 40 20 0 demand is still expected to account for nearly half of the energy mix (46%). While the SDS projects lower oil demand in the 2040 timeframe, the IEA states that Òdecline in production from existing fields creates a need for new upstream projects, even in rapid energy transitionÓ (2020 WEO, page 21). In terms of the continuing upstream oil and gas investment required to meet such demand, in STEPS, projected annual global spending averages about $600 billion to meet demand during the 2020Ð2040 period. In the SDS, continuing investment in both new and existing oil and gas fields remains an important part of the energy transition (see the IEA chart above, right). Approximately $390 billion of annual upstream oil and gas investment is required to meet demand in the 2020Ð2040 period. Since the oil price crash of 2014, upstream oil and gas investment has been significantly curtailed. During the past five years, upstream oil and gas investment has averaged about $400 billion annually, well below historical levels prior to 2014. In 2021, upstream oil and gas investment is projected to average about $320 billion, which is about 20% below the last five year period. Even with a major capital reallocation from fuels to power, the IEAÕs SDS requires upstream oil and gas investment over the next 20 years to approximate the past five years, at slightly under $400 billion per year. The oil and gas industry is a long cycle business, and this continued underinvestment is a risk that could manifest itself as a medium term supply gap, where recent levels of investment are insufficient to meet medium term demand. HessÕ Approach to Scenario Planning The TCFD recommends that, once a less than 2¡C scenario is established, companies should define a base case or business-as.usual outlook for the future. The base case should use the same set of metrics as the less than 2¡C scenario (e.g., oil demand, carbon prices and other market factors) and share the same fundamental economic 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Note: As reported in the IEA 2020 World Energy Outlook.

Establishing multiple scenarios allows measurement of the delta between metrics at future points to properly understand the envelope within which risk and opportunity may occur. HessÕ approach to scenario planning is aligned with the TCFD recommendations. We have prepared internal guidance that details our approach and establishes a specified methodology. This also serves as a roadmap for our external verifier to review and verify that we followed our specified methodology when conducting this scenario analysis. Our first step in this process was to establish a Hess base case, which for 2021 was premised off a $45 per barrel Brent oil price, increasing to $55 per barrel in 2022 through 2040, and a $2.75 per million British thermal units Henry Hub natural gas price held constant for the 2021Ð2040 period; both cost bases are in 2021 real terms. In addition, in the base case, we applied either actual carbon pricing for our assets and intended forward investments (where a regulatory framework for such exists) or used a carbon price of $40 per tonne through 2040 for other geographies. HessÕ base case was then compared against the various oil, natural gas and carbon prices in the IEAÕs two key scenarios Ð STEPS and SDS Ð running our current asset portfolio and intended forward investments through these varying sets of assumptions to assess financial robustness. The three charts below show the oil, natural gas and CO2 prices under the IEAÕs STEPS and SDS against HessÕ base case. As these charts show, there is a wide spread of oil, natural gas and carbon pricing across the two IEA scenarios, a key ingredient for informative scenario planning. CO Price Crude Oil Price Natural Gas Price 2Dollars per MMBtu, 2021 Real TermsU.S. Dollars per Tonne, 2021 Real TermsU.S. Dollars per Barrel, 2021 Real TermsU.S.160 125 100 6 120 80 4 75 50 25 2 40 00 0 2021 2026 2031 2036 2041 2021 2026 2031 2036 2041 2021 2026 2031 2036 2041 ÷ Hess Base Case ÷ IEA Stated Policies Scenario ÷ IEA Sustainable Development Scenario Results of the Hess Scenario Planning Exercise Through our methodology, we have tested the robustness of HessÕ asset portfolio and intended forward investments under multiple energy scenarios, including the IEAÕs SDS. In the chart below, the first column shows the net present value (NPV), at a 10% discount factor, of the Hess portfolio under our base case commodity and carbon prices normalized to 100%, and the second column shows the NPV of the Hess portfolio under the IEAÕs SDS as an index to the Hess base case. The NPV of the Hess portfolio under the IEAÕs SDS assumptions is 10% higher than under the Hess base case assumptions. This demonstrates the robustness of HessÕ portfolio against even the most challenging of the IEAÕs scenarios, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, driven by our conservative planning assumptions as they relate to crude oil prices and the competitive pipeline of future investments in our portfolio. Validation of Hess Strategy With the lower oil demand assumed in the IEAÕs SDS, industry competition will intensify, and higher cost producers may be forced out of the marketplace. Our scenario analysis validates HessÕ strategic priorities to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. This strategy is consistent with the IEAÕs SDS, which envisions a meaningful role for oil and natural gas through 2040, when oil and natural gas are still projected to account for 46% of global primary energy demand. Although recent events and market conditions have necessitated major reductions to our capital and exploratory budget, over the longer term, Hess plans to allocate the majority of our capital expenditures to developing the companyÕs assets located offshore of Guyana and in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Our offshore oil discoveries in Guyana are among the industryÕs largest discoveries made globally over the last decade. The Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2 and Payara developments have long term oil price breakeven costs of between $25 and $35 per barrel Brent oil, at point of sanction for a 10% return. They also have rapid investment payback and strong cash flow generation under a range of oil prices, thereby underpinning and validating HessÕ strategy. Hess Strategic Priorities In the Bakken, Hess has approximately 1,600 and 2,200 locations at $50 per barrel and $60 per barrel West Texas Intermediate (WTI), respectively, that can generate at least a 15% internal rate of return. That equates to greater than 60 to 80 rig years for the company, assuming one rig drills 30 wells per year. We expect that the combination of GuyanaÕs low breakeven costs, along with aggressive cost reduction activities in the Bakken, will contribute substantially to structurally lowering our portfolio breakeven costs to less than $40 per barrel Brent oil by 2025. As a result, Hess is well positioned for the long term to retain our share in the marketplace as a low cost producer, even with the gradually reducing global oil demand projected under the IEAÕs SDS. In summary, based on the results of our 2020 scenario planning analysis, we conclude that it is highly unlikely any of our assets would be ÒstrandedÓ by CO2 pricing including under scenarios that are consistent with the aim of the Paris Agreement Ð and we believe that during the projected period we can continue to monetize our reserves and deliver strong performance under a wide range of market conditions. Hess Bakken Locations with Investment Rate Hess Portfolio NPV Index* of Return of 15% or Higher, as of January 1, 2021 Gross Number of Economic Locations at Various WTI Prices* 2,500  Hess Base IEA Sustainable Case Development Scenario *The NPV index normalizes the value of the Hess portfolio under HessÕ base case to 100% and indexes the value of the Hess portfolio under the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario to the Hess base case.

We are pleased to report that we have significantly surpassed both of these targets. Specifically, Hess has achieved the following: ¥ Reduced the GHG emissions intensity of our operated assets from 41 tonnes per thousand barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2014 to 22 tonnes per thousand BOE in 2020, or by 46% versus our target of 25% Operated Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) 6 50 GHG Intensity (Tonnes per Thousand BOE)40 30 20 10 0 original 25% GHG emissions intensity and in the Bakken.

At that time, we decided to maintain our commitment to achieving our New 2025 Reduction Targets As part of HessÕ updated climate change strategy and in alignment with TCFDÕs criteria for target setting, we have established a new GHG intensity reduction target for 2025, using 2017 as a baseline. primary world energy demand in 2030 versus 2017. HessÕ new GHG intensity reduction target (see table on page 47), is based on our operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions normalized by production. This target results in a 44% GHG intensity reduction between 2017 and 2025, which is more aggressive than the IEA SDSÕ 22% reduction by 2030, and keeps us aligned with the Paris AgreementÕs less than 2¡C ambition. This target is also designed to place us in a leadership position for emissions performance among our peers in the oil and gas industry, based on current publicly available data. Continued flare reduction is a primary driver for achieving our 2025 GHG emissions intensity target and, therefore, we have not established a separate 2025 flare target. However, we continue to focus on gas infrastructure and flare reduction initiatives rate currently required by the NDIC. As part of advancing our updated climate change strategy, Hess has established a new executive led task force (described more fully on page 41) that will evaluate the medium and longer term aspects of our strategy. Our new target is to reduce the GHGFlaring Intensity (SCF per BOE)250 While natural gas continues to play aemissions intensity of our operated assets critical role in the transition to a low carbonto 17 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxideFlaring (MMSCFD) 200 economy, there remains debate aboutequivalent (CO2e) per BOE by 2025 versus fugitive methane leakage along the natural150 a 2017 baseline of 30 kg CO2e per BOE. gas value chain and whether that may haveWe aligned this GHG intensity reduction100 the potential to reduce this fuelÕs climatetarget with the IEAÕs WEO 2020 SDS, 74 71 60 51 52 the ONE Future Coalition, a group ofreduction by 2030 versus 2017 in order to 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 0 be consistent with the Paris AgreementÕs companies from the natural gas industry ÷ Divested Assets focused on reducing methane emissionsless than 2¡C ambition.

Our voluntary commitments to pursue emissions reductions through these groups are described further on pages 51Ð52. Consistent with these efforts, Hess is setting a new target, detailed in the table at right, to reduce operated methane emissions intensity to 0.19% by 2025. This target equates to a 52% reduction in methane emissions intensity versus our 2017 baseline. We expect that our continued efforts to increase natural gas capture and reduce flaring, paired with our leak detection and repair program and replacement and retrofit of the remaining high bleed pneumatic controllers in our North Dakota operations, will support achieving this target. GREENHOUSE GAS PERFORMANCE We report GHG emissions from our oil and gas assets on both operated and equity bases. Our GHG emissions estimates include CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, which are reported in units of CO2e. In 2014, Hess began using global warming potentials based on the values in the Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 (AR-4), prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to estimate CO2e totals. Approximately 94% of HessÕ direct reported (Scope 1) operated GHG emissions are from stationary combustion sources such as flaring, heaters, turbines and engines. The factors used to estimate emissions for these sources enterprisewide are those prescribed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart C). The remaining 6% of our reported operated GHG emissions are from a variety of noncombustion and fugitive emissions sources, such as storage tanks, compressor seals, pneumatic pumps and valves. For such sources at onshore facilities, we use the emissions Baseline  Target  GHG Emissions Intensity  Year  Year  2017  2025  Production (Millions of BOE) 92 --.Denominator GHG Emissions Intensity 30 17(kg CO2e per BOE) Baseline  Target  Methane Emissions Intensity  Year  Year  2017  2025  Natural Gas Sales (Million Cubic Meters) 3,318 --.Denominator Methane Emissions Intensity (%) (Methane Emissions per Sales 0.40 0.19 of Natural Gas)   Notes: Production includes oil and natural gas liquids production and natural gas sales. For our 2025 target, we have adjusted our baseline denominator to reflect actual natural gas sales rather than wellhead production in order to better align with metrics established by other oil and gas companies. With this change in methodology, our 2017 GHG intensity changes from 34 to 30 kg CO2e per BOE. Our 2017 baseline year data have also been adjusted to exclude the South Arne asset in Denmark. In March 2021, Hess entered into an agreement to sell its interests in Denmark with an effective date of January 1, 2021. The sale is expected to close during the third quarter of 2021. factors prescribed by the EPA in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W). Hess uses other appropriate regulatory or industry specific factors to estimate fugitive emissions for all other facilities. We also report indirect emissions associated with purchased electricity (Scope 2) and other indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Operated Emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) In 2020, of the estimated 3.7 million tonnes of gross GHG emissions reported from our operated oil and gas assets, 3.3 million tonnes were Scope 1 emissions, primarily from flaring and fuel combustion, and approximately 0.4 million tonnes were Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity. Process operations (primarily fuel combustion) and flaring accounted for 38% and 56% of our Scope 1 GHG emissions, respectively. In 2020, our absolute GHG emissions decreased by 0.7 million tonnes compared with 2019, due primarily to a significant reduction in natural gas flaring in North Dakota associated with aggressive expansion of our natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure. Our cumulative GHG emissions intensity through 2020 (i.e., tonnes of emissions per thousand BOE) decreased by 46% compared to our 2014 baseline, thereby significantly surpassing our 25% GHG intensity reduction target for 2020. Equity Emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Since 2007, Hess has tracked GHG emissions from our operated and nonoperated oil and gas assets based on our equity interest. The graphs on page 48 detail our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from 2008 to 2020 on an equity basis. These graphs show that over the past 13 years we have reduced our absolute Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions from 10.8 million tonnes of CO2e to 4.4 million tonnes, or approximately 59%. During the same period, Scope 3 equity emissions decreased from 114 million tonnes to 53 million tonnes of CO2e, or 53%. In total, over this period, our combined Scope 1, 2 and 3 absolute CO2e emissions have decreased 54% through a combination of emissions reduction initiatives, asset sales and refinery shutdowns. Scope 1 and 2 Equity Emissions Our major source of Scope 1 and 2 emissions from nonoperated oil and gas assets in 2020 was from the A-18 Block in the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area. Our equity emissions from this asset were approximately 1.1 million tonnes, a decrease of 0.1 million tonnes from 2019.  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY Major sources of emissions from our 2020 Operated Scope 1  operated assets in 2020 included those  Greenhouse Gas Emissions  from the Tioga Gas Plant and our North  by Source  Dakota, North Malay Basin and offshore  Thousand Tonnes COe2 Gulf of Mexico production assets, which  to a more efficient end use of hydrocarbon products. A policy that puts a price on carbon should ensure uniform cost of GHG emissions on a CO2e basis throughout the global economy and should address key pricing risks, such as carbon leakage, energy affordability and policy durability, and equity issues such as regressive impacts on underdeveloped communities. To estimate our Scope 3 emissions, we follow the methodology established by IPIECA in its 2016 report Estimating Petroleum Industry Value Chain (Scope 3) together accounted for an estimated 2.4 million tonnes of equity emissions. Our other operated and nonoperated assets made up the balance of equity emissions at an estimated 0.9 million tonnes, of which Guyana accounted for approximately 0.4 million tonnes from the first full year of production for the Liza 1 development. Our 2020 Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions were approximately 0.1 million tonnes higher than in 2019, primarily due to increased production. Scope 3 Equity Emissions Scope 3 GHG emissions are those generated from corporate value chain activities that are not accounted for and reported in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We disclose our Scope 3 GHG emissions, the vast majority of which are from the processing and end use of our sold products, on an equity basis as described below. Unlike fully integrated energy companies that are positioned to offer a full range of energy products and services directly to consumers, Hess, as an exploration and production company, has no direct control over these Scope 3 emissions. Therefore, we are focusing on scientific solutions and ÷ Fuel Combustion 1,231 ÷ Other 197 Note: The aring total above includes 567 tonnes of CO2e emissions from venting. Equity Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by Country Million Tonnes CO2e 10.8 10 8 6 4.3 4.44.0 3.9 4 2 0 2008 2017 2018 2019 2020 ÷ Denmark ÷ Guyana ÷ Libya ÷ Malaysia ÷ Malaysia/Thailand ÷ U.S. ÷ Divested Assets Equity Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 3) ÷ Flaring 1,823 plant based carbon capture and storage by the Salk Institute is described on page 49. Hess supports a carbon price to encourage the investments needed to accelerate decarbonization across all sectors of the economy while keeping energy affordable. We believe that a market based mechanism will drive innovation for new technologies and lead Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This guidance, which is currently the industry standard, is based on the World Resources InstituteÕs and World Business Council for Sustainable DevelopmentÕs Scope 3 guidance. Per the IPIECA guidance, we report Scope 3 emissions for category 11 ÒUse of Sold ProductsÓ by calculating combustion emissions for our oil, natural gas and marketed oil products. We also report Scope 3 category 10 ÒProcessing of Sold ProductsÓ emissions, which result from the refining of our crude oil production by others. In 2020, we sold 554 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of natural gas, which, when used by customers, accounted for an estimated 11 million tonnes of GHG emissions. We sold 239 thousand barrels per day of crude oil, which accounted for another 38 million tonnes of GHG emissions, for an estimated total of 49 million tonnes of Million Tonnes CO e Million Tonnes CO2e Million Tonnes CO2e Scope 3 category 11 emissions.

The 8% increase in Scope 3 emissions compared with 2019 is primarily related to a 6% increase in oil equivalent sales year over year, as well as a shift in product mix to slightly more oil sales relative to natural gas. Although not material, we also track and report Scope 3 emissions associated with employee business travel. Combined emissions from employee business travel via commercial air carrier and rail in 2020 were less than 1,000 tonnes of CO2e, significantly reduced from prior years due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Carbon Offsets As an element of our EHS & SR strategy, we purchase carbon credits annually to offset 100% of our Scope 3 business travel emissions and 100% of our Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions associated with operating the companyÕs truck fleet, aviation activities (aircraft and helicopters) and personal and rental vehicle miles driven while on company business. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both business travel and fleet operations emissions were considerably reduced from 15,340 tonnes of CO2e in 2019 to 9,800 tonnes in 2020. We purchased 9,800 tonnes of carbon credits from 3Degrees for the retirement of offsets related to a third party landfill gas-to.energy project in Montana. This contribution offset 100% of the GHG emissions we estimate were generated from our business travel (694 tonnes of Scope 3 emissions) and company operated truck fleet, aviation activities and vehicle miles driven in 2020 (9,082 tonnes of Scope 1 and 3 emissions). EMISSIONS REDUCTION INITIATIVES In support of our GHG emissions and flaring intensity reduction targets, we track and monitor air emissions at each of our assets and undertake a variety of emissions reduction initiatives. Our efforts focus on our largest emitting facilities, on opportunities that are technically and economically feasible, and where we are able to achieve stakeholder approval. As discussed earlier, we established a new executive led task force in 2020 to  provide oversight for our climate change strategy implementation and to evaluate the medium and longer term aspects of As an additional measure beyond our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, which is currently focused on our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we are pursuing ways to help mitigate climate change on a global scale. We are now into our second year of a five year commitment of $12.5 million to help fund the Salk InstituteÕs Harnessing Plants Initiative research and development program. As our CEO, John Hess, stated, ÒWhat better way to help tackle the challenge of climate change than by harnessing the power of Mother Nature, which has been capturing and storing carbon since the beginning of time. Research being done at the Salk Institute has the potential to be a game changer in addressing climate change.Ó SalkÕs research is a bold, scalable approach aimed at using plants to mitigate climate change. The initiative is run by leading biologists and chemists in the fields of plant genetics and biochemistry and builds on their discovery of a crucial gene to enhance the natural abilities of plants to store CO2. One track of SalkÕs research, the Harnessing Plants Initiative, is targeted at developing plants that can store more carbon and keep it in the soil longer. The aim is to develop plants with larger root systems that, according to the Salk Institute, are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. Hess recently donated an additional $3 million to create a newly endowed Hess Chair in Plant Science, intended to recognize outstanding individuals making a significant impact on plant science research. The first holder of the Hess Chair in Plant Science, Wolfgang Busch, is being recognized for his contributions and dedication to advancing science through research. our strategy. A subgroup of this task force will focus on identifying and recommending GHG reduction opportunities, evaluating and implementing technologies as appropriate and evaluating capital and infrastructure requirements. Initially, the group is considering the following: ¥ Optimizing field development and infrastructure plans for our Bakken operations ¥ Examining alternatives to wellhead flaring, such as utilizing natural gas for onsite power generation or conversion to liquified natural gas ¥ Examining Power Purchase Agreements to address HessÕ electricity needs through renewable energy, thereby offsetting or eliminating our Scope 2 GHG emissions The subgroup will report out on these initiatives to our Chief Operating OfficerÕs operating committee. Flaring In 2020, flaring from Hess operated assets totaled 52 MMSCFD, a decrease of 19 MMSCFD or nearly 27% compared with 2019, primarily related to our focus on natural gas capture through increased availability and reliability at our compressor stations, with reliability increasing from 87% in 2019 to 95%; aggressive expansion of gathering infrastructure; enhanced communication with third party gatherers; and improved planning of new wells to prioritize gathering of new natural gas production. We are taking multiple steps, which are described on the following pages, to continue to drive flare reductions in the next several years. On an intensity basis, we have reduced our cumulative flaring intensity by over 59% through 2020 compared with our 2014 baseline. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY Emissions Reduction Initiatives The following case studies are additional examples of emissions reduction initiatives at Hess. Natural Gas Capture We have continued to use technology developed through our partnership with GTUIT Ð a designer, manufacturer and operator of wellsite natural gas capture and natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction equipment Ð to recover high British thermal unit (BTU) gas from locations in North Dakota that were previously flaring this raw, wet natural gas. The GTUIT equipment successfully addresses some of the technical challenges associated with capturing NGLs from the Bakken gas. The units are modular and mobile, they can operate reliably unmanned, and they can adapt to the changing flow conditions at the well level. In 2020, we operated four GTUIT mobile units and two ColdStream energy recovery units (14 MMSCFD of capacity in total), allowing us to capture 2.2 million gallons of NGLs. As a result of this NGL capture, about 120 MMSCFD of gas flaring was avoided, and CO2e emissions were reduced by an estimated 13,705 tonnes. This project provides dual economic and environmental benefits because it converts gas into marketable products, as well as reduces the amount of gas flared and the associated air emissions. Utilization of the units was scaled back in 2020 due to the pandemic amid record low commodity prices. Flexible Hose for Freshwater Transport In North Dakota, we continue to utilize flexible hose to transport fresh water directly from the water sources to our wells, instead of using truck transport. In 2020, 100% of the water we used for hydraulic fracturing in North Dakota (approximately 20 million barrels) was transported using flexible hoses, eliminating 178,042 truck deliveries and 8.9 million truck miles driven and reducing about 19,392 tonnes of transportation related GHG emissions. Utilizing Wellsite Natural Gas for Electricity In 2020, we initiated a pilot project through a company called Digital Stream Energy to take natural gas from a wellsite that would otherwise be flared to generate electricity. The electricity generated is used to power computer servers. The natural gas consumed by this pilot project was 250,000 SCFD, which equated to around 1,300 tonnes of CO2e emissions in 2020. We will continue to monitor this pilot and will evaluate expansion options at additional wellsites. Replacement of Diesel with Natural Gas Hess Midstream LPÕs compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel facility near the Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota has been in operation since 2016. The CNG is partially displacing diesel in high horsepower engines for drilling and in water heaters for well completion operations in the region and is capable of fueling CNG/gasoline bifuel light duty trucks. In 2020, the operation of this facility helped to displace 1,230,000 gallons of diesel fuel, resulting in a reduction of 3,561 tonnes of CO2e. Initiatives to Reduce Flaring in Midstream Operations In 2020, several initiatives were pursued to reduce flaring at individual compressor stations and the Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota. One such effort, for which we collaborated with Kinder Morgan, is detailed in the Social Responsibility section of this report (page 23). As a result of these efforts, in total, our Bakken flaring volume was reduced by 1 billion cubic feet in 2020, which is equivalent to a reduction of 81,238 tonnes of CO2e. More than $3.4 billion has been spent on  will increase plant capacity from 250  Ultimately, the increased capacity  midstream infrastructure in North Dakota  MMSCFD to 400 MMSCFD and allow  gained from the expansion project will  over the past nine years, supporting our  the plant to process a combination  help reduce flaring in future years.  strong performance in 2020. Through our subsidiary, Hess Midstream LP, we are continuing to execute significant capital projects to increase natural gas capture rates and reduce flaring in the Bakken region. ¥ The Tioga Gas Plant is planned to be shut down for approximately 45 days in the third quarter of 2021 to complete a turnaround that will allow for required maintenance and completion of the $150 million expansion project that  of additional Hess and third party natural gas. During the turnaround, we will lose the capacity to gather and process natural gas at the Tioga Gas Plant. This will likely result in a temporary increase in flaring at certain sites where allowed by applicable regulations. It will be our aim to limit this nonroutine flaring, but it is likely that there will be some impact on our 2021 GHG emissions performance.  ¥ As a result of limited gas capture and processing facilities, increased volumes of gas were flared south of the Missouri River prior to 2019. Hess Midstream LP partnered with Targa Resources to build a new $200 million gas plant, the Little Missouri Four gas plant, which came online in August 2019 and can process up to 200 MMSCFD of natural gas that had previously been flared. Hess Midstream LP is now able to  commenced in 2020. The expansion  utilize the plant as planned.  ¥ Over the last 30 months, Hess Midstream LP has added approximately 200 MMSCFD of additional gas compression capacity. Two new compression stations were built at Blue Buttes and East Nesson, and the Wheelock, Sorkness and Myrtle compressor stations each had two compressors that were added. Hess Midstream LP also reactivated the Silurian and Legacy Blue Buttes Compressor Stations and will be activating an additional 14 MMSCFD of capacity at the new Blue Buttes Compressor Station in the second quarter of 2021, which will significantly expand our ability to bring more natural gas to market. Over the next several years, we plan to continue to pursue additional natural gas processing and compression capacity, which will help us continue to reduce flaring. At many of our production facilities, Hess relies on third parties to provide the natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure needed to mitigate gas flaring. In 2019, the rate of gas capture by third party gathering and processing facilities was less than expected. In 2020, we made significant inroads in improving third party gathering and processing rates by enhancing communication to share learnings and collaborate on improving capacity. We are continuing to explore additional commercial arrangements to improve third party gas gathering and processing capacity in an attempt to minimize flaring. Methane In 2020, our total Scope 1 methane emissions were around 10,900 tonnes, down from around 12,800 tonnes in 2019. This equates to around 272,200 tonnes of CO2e (assuming a Global Warming Potential of 25), which represents around 9% of our operated Scope 1 GHG emissions. Our major sources of methane are fugitive emissions from pneumatic devices, pumps, tanks, compressor seals and pipelines, and the residual unburned methane associated with flaring. Stakeholder interest in methane emissions has been at the forefront in recent years. The Biden Administration has committed to review the EPAÕs and Bureau of Land ManagementÕs regulations to control methane emissions from oil and gas operations and revise them as needed. The oil and gas industry, through the American Petroleum Institute (API), has expressed its willingness to work with the Biden Administration and other interested stakeholders to advance direct regulation of methane from both new and existing sources as part of APIÕs new Climate Action Framework. One ongoing element of our EHS & SR strategy has been to pursue voluntary reductions in methane emissions from two angles: performance based targets and best practices. In support of our strategy, in 2014, Hess and seven other companies founded the ONE Future Coalition Ð a group with representation from across the natural gas industry focused on identifying policy and technical solutions that yield continuous improvement in the management of methane emissions associated with the production, processing, transportation and distribution of natural gas. By the end of 2020, ONE Future membership had grown to around 40 companies. ONE Future offers a performance based, flexible approach that is expected to yield significant reductions in methane emissions. ONE FutureÕs measurement protocol has been approved by the EPA. The goal of ONE Future is to voluntarily lower methane emissions to less than 1% of gross methane production across the U.S. value chain by 2025. Peer reviewed analyses indicate that a leak/loss rate of 1% or less across the U.S. natural gas value chain provides immediate GHG reduction benefits. To achieve this goal, ONE Future has established 2025 methane emissions rate targets for each sector of the natural gas value chain: production (0.28%), gathering and boosting (0.08%), processing (0.11%), transmission and storage (0.30%) and distribution (0.22%), which cumulatively total the 1% target. The combined target for the three sectors in which Hess has operations (production, gathering and boosting and processing) is 0.47%.  In 2019, the ONE Future membersÕ cumulative methane emissions intensity was 0.33% across the U.S. onshore natural gas value chain, the same as in 2018. The improvements made in methane intensity performance by ONE Future companies since 2014 have been acknowledged by the U.S. Department of EnergyÕs National Energy Technology Laboratory in a number of studies. ONE FutureÕs 2020 progress report will be published later this year. In 2020, HessÕ onshore U.S. methane intensity was 0.51%, slightly above the 2025 ONE Future combined target of 0.47% for the sectors in which we operate. Our relative methane intensity continues to improve, and we attribute this to the continued implementation of our leak detection and repair (LDAR) program across all of our North Dakota production facilities and our program to phase out high bleed pneumatic controllers. We anticipate that we will achieve the ONE Future targets by 2025. Our combined U.S. methane emissions intensity across our onshore and offshore operations was 0.22% in 2020, while our global methane intensity was 0.15% Ð both based on the ONE Future Protocol calculation methodology. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY Hess Upstream Methane Emissions Intensity, based on the ONE Future Protocol Methodology (Tonnes Methane Emitted/Tonnes Methane Produced) 0.80%  0.70%  0.60%  0.50%  0.40%  0.30%  0.20%  0.10%  0.00%  U.S. Onshore Production ÷ 2017  U.S. Onshore Gas Gathering and Boosting ÷ 2018 ÷ 2019  In addition to these commitments, as part of our EHS & SR strategy update, we established a 2025 global methane intensity target. Our new target uses natural gas sales as a denominator, where the ONE Future Protocol uses methane production. For our new global methane intensity target of 0.19% by 2025, we are using a 2017 baseline intensity of 0.40%; our 2020 intensity based on this methodology was 0.22%. We will continue to report progress on the ONE Future targets for our onshore U.S. operations in addition to progress on our new global target. Other External Commitments In a related voluntary effort to adopt and promote industry best practices, Hess became one of the founding participants of The Environmental Partnership (The Partnership) in 2017. The Partnership is focused on technologically feasible and commercially proven solutions that result in significant emissions reductions. In addition to specifying best practices for member companies over specific timeframes, The Partnership provides a forum for participants to share information and U.S. Onshore U.S. Onshore Global Processing Upstream Production ÷ 2020 ONE Future 2025 Target analyze best practices and technological breakthroughs in order to help the industry improve its understanding of emissions reduction strategies. A key goal of The Partnership is furthering action to reduce air emissions associated with natural gas and oil production. The Partnership has initiated several programs and allows member companies to decide which are best suited for their operations. The Partnership originally launched three oil and gas emissions reduction programs for member companies to implement and phase into their operations starting January 1, 2018. Hess was one of the first companies to commit to participating, and we have been implementing the two programs applicable to our operations in North Dakota, as follows: ¥ Leak Program for Natural Gas and Oil Production Sources: Participants will implement monitoring and timely repair of fugitive emissions at selected sites utilizing detection methods and technologies such as EPA Method 21 or optical gas imaging cameras. Hess conducted 850 semiannual surveys at 421 sites in 2020. ¥ Program to Replace, Remove or Retrofit High Bleed Pneumatic Controllers: Participants will remove, replace or retrofit high bleed pneumatic controllers with low or zero emitting devices within five years. After identifying 248 high bleed pneumatic controllers remaining in our North Dakota operations, we have begun phasing them out of service. By the end of 2020, we had taken 181 high bleed pneumatic controllers out of service; we plan to phase the remaining 67 out by 2022. The third original program, involving manual liquids unloading for natural gas production sources, is not applicable to Hess because we do not currently operate any natural gas-only production wells. The Partnership initiated three new voluntary programs in 2020 focused on pipeline blowdowns, compressor station emissions reductions and flare management. Hess has committed to participating in all three programs and was able to shape the Flare Management Program by serving as the development co-chair. Companies participating in the Flare Management Program commit to advance best practices that reduce flare volumes, promote the beneficial use of associated gas, improve flare reliability and efficiency when flaring does occur, and collect data to calculate flare intensity as the key metric to gauge progress from year to year. Hess submits information on our implementation of all of these programs to The Partnership, which in turn publishes an annual report every summer. We also plan to report on our progress in each of these programs as part of our annual sustainability report. In line with our commitments through The Partnership and ONE Future, in 2020, we continued implementation of our LDAR program across all Hess operated facilities in North Dakota. Further detail on our LDAR program is provided in the Environment section of this report and at hess.com/sustainability/ environment ENERGY USE Reducing our energy use has the dual benefit of lowering costs and GHG emissions, and it is a central focus of both our EHS & SR strategy and our Lean approach to managing our business. We generate and purchase energy primarily for power, processing, heating and cooling. In 2020, energy consumption from Hess operated assets was approximately 28 million gigajoules, 2% lower than in 2019. Seventy-two percent of HessÕ energy use was directly generated from our operations, primarily at the Tioga Gas Plant and at our production facilities in North Dakota, the North Malay Basin, Denmark and the Gulf of Mexico. The remaining 28% was indirect energy (i.e., energy used by utilities to provide electricity) purchased for our North Dakota production operations and the Tioga Gas Plant. In 2020, our U.S. operations accounted for all of our purchased electricity of approximately 840,000 megawatt hours (MWh), or a 20% increase from last year, primarily attributable to increased production in North Dakota and the conversion of new compressor stations from natural gas to electric compression. Based on U.S. electricity generation profiles, we estimate that approximately 27% of this electricity was generated from renewable sources, primarily wind power. We also support renewable energy through the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs) so that, in total, 100% of the net electricity used in our operations is attributable to renewable sources. To offset our purchased electricity that came from nonrenewable sources, we purchased 634,000 Green-e Energy certified RECs from Multiple Mix Products, including wind, solar, biomass, landfill, geothermal or hydroelectric, equivalent to 634,000 MWh or about 76% of the electricity purchased for our operated Energy Use Thousand Gigajoules 35,000 30,653 30,000 25,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 0 ÷ Direct ÷ Indirect exploration and production assets in 2020.

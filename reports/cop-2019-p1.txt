Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance
A Message from Our Chairman and CEOAs I write this, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented socialand economic upheavals worldwide, undermining oil demand at a timewhen our industry already faced a growing oversupply. The subsequentoil price collapse tested the strength of our strategic planning.ConocoPhillips responded e.ciently and adapted quickly, stepping up tothe challenges of a volatile and uncertain market that is now in earlyrecovery. I am proud of the e.orts of our employees and appreciative ofthe support of our stakeholders.During these trying times, our top priorities have been protecting thewellbeing of our workforce and their families, mitigating the spread ofCOVID-19, and running the business safely. Yet we have also retainedfocus on our core mission Ð investing in development of the energysupply essential to human and economic progress, while e.ectivelymanaging social and environmental concerns, including climate change.In doing so, we are striving to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreementto manage climate in the context of sustainable development, and theUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals that guide global actionsto address social and environmental issues. In addition, we are conducting our business in a manner to maintain our.nancial viability and competitiveness through an energy transition.Our business planning process tests portfolio and capital allocation choices against a wide range of energyscenarios. It incorporates input from stakeholders and establishes priorities based on regular assessments ofbusiness risk and impact. The resulting business plan is by design responsive to challenges and resilient to risks. Itre.ects and leverages our competitive advantages, including strategic .exibility, low cost of supply, low sustainingprice and strong balance sheet.Along with .nancial performance, we are committed to performance with a purpose and broader sustainability. Thishas been the case since the 2003 introduction of our .rst sustainable development and climate change positions.Now collectively referred to as ESG (environmental, social and governance) performance, the concept entailsresponsibly delivering long-term value to all stakeholders, including our home communities, employees andshareholders.In serving the communities where we live and work, we provide investment and jobs, mitigate impacts to waterresources and biodiversity and respond to local concerns. For investors, governance-related priorities includemanagement of environmental and social risks, for which responsibility extends from our board of directorsdownward to our executive leadership team and managers and employees at all levels. Their assessments of risksinform decisions ranging from long-term strategy to facility design. For stakeholders in general, priorities includemanagement of risks related to climate change, human capital management, human rights and protection of waterresources.Chairman and CEO Ryan LanceCS 102Board of DirectorsPublic Policy CoitteeSustainable eelopent eanironental ssurance roupExecutive Leadership Team (ELT)Sustainable Development Leadership Team (SDLT)Health, Safety & Environment Leadership Team (HSELT)Business Units Chapions or uan Rights Staeholer ngageent ater ioiersity Cliate Change eaership eas Subect atter perts an lobal Issue oring roups or uan RightsStaeholer ngageent ater ioiersity Cliate ChangeIssues considered by the PPC are regularly reported to the full board.AdustInnovate andContinuously ImproveManagement System Approach to Sustainable Development RiskCounicate riss to eecuties an boar o irectorsinput to terprise Ris anageentngageeasure an onitorrac an assess actionsIentiy an apeelop ris register hich rans corporateie an local rissress RisCollaborate on strategies an action plans to anage rane rissthe company, from business development activities and exploration to developing major capital projects andmanaging our day to day operations.SD Risk ManagementStandardIdentify social and environmental risks, conduct risk ranking and develop mitigationaction plans.Applies to all operated assets and projects.HSE Social and DueDiligence StandardIdentify risks and liabilities related to health, safety, environment, regulatory and socialissues for new acquisitions, new business ventures, joint ventures and real propertytransactions.Applies to all operated assets and projects.HSE Management SystemStandardIdentify and manage operational risks to the business, employees, contractors,stakeholders and environment.Applies to all operated assets and projects.

For example, our ability to manage GHG emissions canhelp us measure resilience to emerging carbon tax regulation.In 2019, our total gross operated GHG emissions, in CO2 equivalent terms, were approximately 20.5 million tonnes, adecrease of about 1.4% from 2018. The reduction was driven primarily by our UK asset disposition, downtime atSurmont due to a turnaround, and reduced production and LNG plant throughput at Darwin LNG. This was partlyo.set by increases from continued development in Lower 48 and increased .aring and LNG plant throughput atAPLNG. Our overall GHG emissions intensity increased by 4.6% in 2019.

In accordance with our aim to improve the disclosure of risk to our stakeholders, we have integrated climate relatedSustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics into our 2019 performance metrics. of energy to extract the product and transport itfor processing or re.ning. Newer operations tendto be more energy intensive as well.Total energy consumption in 2019 was 225 trillionBritish Thermal Units (BTUs), a decrease of about4.6%. The reduction was due to our UKdisposition, a turnaround at Surmont and lowproduction at Darwin LNG. This was partly o.setby increased .eld gas compression for our EagleFord and Indonesia assets and increasedproduction at APLNG. Approximately 98% of ourconsumption was from combustion of fuel for our own energy use with the remaining  from purchased electricity.  Low-Carbon Emitting ProductsIn 2019, we supplied consumers with approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (or 2.8 billion cubic feet per day) of naturalgas. To put this in perspective, if all the natural gas we produced in 2019 had been used to replace coal for electricitygeneration, GHG emissions would have been reduced by approximately 52 million metric tons, more than doublethe companyÕs combined scope 1 and scope 2 emissions for the year.CDPThe annual CDP survey collects a wide range of information concerning corporate e.orts to manage climate changeissues e.ectively and drive emissions reductions. It includes an emphasis on governance, strategy, actions andreporting to try to provide a complete view of companiesÕ performance for comparison. It also provides a view ofsector performance. ConocoPhillips has participated in the survey since 2003. Our most recent CDP submission canbe found in the 2019 CDP document.Read more about our Performance Metrics and SASB metrics.

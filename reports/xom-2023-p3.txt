We recognize the important role that supportive government policies play in the development and deployment of lower-emission technologies, including those that are part of our Low Carbon Solutions business . Understanding life-cycle emissions to better inform policy decisions We have been working with the MIT Energy Initiative to develop a new life-cycle approach tool that covers pathways of multiple technologies representing most sources of greenhouse gas emissions . This tool, called the Sustainable Energy System Analysis Modeling Environment (SESAME),72 is based on well-referenced, peer-reviewed public sources and will evolve to perform full life-cycle analyses for more than 1,000 technology pathways, from primary energy sources to final products or services including those from the power, transportation, industrial, and residential sectors . To date, a series of SESAME-related publications in peer-reviewed journals have been released exploring areas such as the U .S . electric power systems .85, 86, 87 Clear and consistent policies, along with advancements in technology, can act as an accelerator for lower-emission alternatives, which is why we actively participate in climate-related policy engagements around the world, including our work with the IPCC . Our focus is on practical policy solutions that take into account increasing global demand for affordable and reliable energy while enabling scalable development and deployment of lower and zero-greenhouse gas emission technologies . For example, a coordinated and transparent economy-wide price on carbon such as a carbon tax would enable all technologies to compete and cost-effectively lower carbon emissions intensity by focusing on reducing emissions per unit of energy while delivering meaningful emission reductions . Broad adoption of an economy-wide price on carbon could also help spur the development of global carbon markets as envisioned in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement . In the absence of economy-wide carbon pricing, well-designed sector-based policy options, along with technology advancements, could also be an effective way to reduce emissions . We support the approaches outlined below, which help address greenhouse gas emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, transportation, and power generation . Manufacturing To reduce industrial emissions in the manufacturing sector, our focus is on carbon capture and storage and hydrogen . To drive investment and deploy these technologies at the pace and scale needed for a net-zero future, governments must establish durable regulatory and legal frameworks as well as incentives similar to those available for more established lower-emission technologies such as solar and wind . The U .S . Congress recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides some of the government support described in this document . The IRA leverages a life-cycle assessment approach as the method for assessing the greenhouse gas emissions of low-carbon hydrogen and transportation fuels, and defines the value of corresponding credit by the emissions intensity achieved on a life-cycle basis . We support a policy and regulatory framework for carbon capture and storage that would: • Sustain long-term government support for research and development . • Provide standards to ensure safe and secure CO. storage. • Allow for fit-for-purpose CO. injection well design standards . • Provide legal certainty for geologic storage ownership . • Ensure a streamlined permitting process for carbon capture and storage facilities . • Provide access to CO. storage capacity owned or controlled by governments . • Allow for high-quality offsets generated from carbon capture and storage, low-carbon, and carbon-removal projects . We are participating in several studies, including the National Petroleum Council’s report on low-carbon hydrogen, to assess emissions during hydrogen production and transportation as well as the benefits of hydrogen on a full life-cycle intensity basis versus alternatives . Transportation A holistic low-carbon transport policy that combines a market-based, technology-neutral fuel standard with a life-cycle vehicle CO. emission standard could drive emission reductions across the entire vehicle fleet . We advocate for a carbon intensity-based fuel standard approach that can also be extended to the aviation and marine sectors . We are a lead participant in developing the American Petroleum Institute’s policy framework that includes actions to reduce life-cycle emissions in the U .S . transportation sector . Power generation A technology-neutral clean-energy standard or carbon-intensity standard could reduce CO. emissions in the electricity sector by setting targets based on carbon intensity and incentivizing necessary infrastructure and lower-emission options . These include natural gas, renewables, and bioenergy, as well as negative-emission technologies like carbon capture and storage and direct air capture . We participated in the U .S . Chamber of Commerce’s development of policy principles to underpin a U .S . clean energy standard for the electricity sector . We continue to support engagement with the U .S . government on this issue . As part of our participation in policy discussions, we engage through trade associations and industry collaborations, including the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative . We use various communication channels including this report, press releases, exxonmobil.com, and the Exxchange advocacy portal to clearly and transparently articulate our climate-related policy positions . These positions inform and provide the basis for our lobbying and advocacy efforts . U.S. Inflation Reduction Act 45V credit by GHG intensity Well-to-gate GHG intensity, kg CO.e/kg H. Source: H .R .5376 - Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Sec . 45V .

In 2020, we announced plans to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, compared to 2016 levels, which coincides with the Paris Agreement . This included a 15-20% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of upstream operations; a 40-50% reduction in methane intensity; and a 35-45% reduction in flaring intensity across the company . We achieved these 2025 emission-reduction plans in 2021 – four years ahead of schedule . That same year, we announced new medium-term Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans for 2030 for operated assets, compared to 2016 levels .7 Our 2030 plans are detailed starting on Page 6 of this report . Greenhouse gas emissions performance data8 We assess our performance to support continuous improvement throughout the organization . The reporting guidelines and indicators of Ipieca, the American Petroleum Institute (API), and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry (2020) informed the selection of the data included in this performance table . These guidelines are based on the GHG Protocol . The performance data in the July 2022 Advancing Climate Solutions Progress Report was based upon IPCC AR4 . The following data table is based upon IPCC AR6 .90 Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance has provided their independent limited level of assurance that the 2021 ExxonMobil greenhouse gas emissions inventory meets ISO 14064-3 expectations . Managing the risks of climate change Click here for the GHG Data Supplement Section 20 |  Greenhouse gas emissions performance data Operated basis  Units  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  Net GHG (excludes exported power and heat)91  (million metric tons CO.e)  114  110  112  107  100  100  Scope 1 GHG emissions92  (million metric tons CO.e)  109  104  106  100  95  96  CO.

Some of these indicators recognize the work ExxonMobil is doing, such as our alignment with the core elements of the TCFD framework . We believe that the most recent analysis of ExxonMobil by Climate Action 100+ does not recognize the work we have done in meeting those indicators, such as indicator 3 (Medium-term Reduction Targets), indicator 5 (Decarbonization Strategy), and indicator 6 (Capital Allocation Alignment) . Separately, we believe that other metrics used by Climate Action 100+, such as a requirement to set Scope 3 reduction targets, are too narrow of an approach to evaluate a company’s efforts and contributions to helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and may result in artificially constraining supply, which can lead to shortages, regressive inflationary pressure, or an increase in societal greenhouse gases .

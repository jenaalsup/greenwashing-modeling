POWERING THE FUTURE • Job creation • CO2 emission avoided POWERING THE FUTURE The solar industry is powering a clean energy future while driving economic progress. We’re providing more communities, businesses and households with solar energy, which generates far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels. In fact, solar was the number one source of new electricity generation ahead of natural gas and coal, according to a U.S. Solar Market Insight report. According to the report, in 2016 the U.S. increased its solar (PV) installations by 95%, the highest growth rate on record. Growing the solar industry and the economy As the solar industry grows, so do job opportunities. According to the 2016 National Solar Jobs Census: More than 260,000 people currently work in the solar industry (three times more than in 2010) Solar jobs grew by more than 20% for the fourth consecutive year, adding 51,000 jobs 1 in 50 new U.S. jobs were in the solar industry, representing 2% of all new jobs Additionally, while the solar industry employs its fair share of scientists and engineers, most solar jobs don’t require a bachelor’s degree. According to the Department of Energy the construction industry employs 40% of solar workers, with solar installers making an average of $26 per hour according to the census. At the end of 2016, SunPower employed over 7,000 people globally, adding 1,000 jobs and growing our workforce by 15% since December 2013. We also provided opportunities to more than 10,000 workers through our network of 400 local dealers and installers. Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions By generating electricity from the sun instead of fossil fuels, SunPower’s products have avoided 27 million tons of CO2 since 2006. According to estimates provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, that’s equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions from powering 2.85 million homes (roughly the population of Chicago). And results are improving every year. In 2016 alone, installed SunPower® products avoided 7.27 million tons—equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions from powering 767,000 homes (roughly the population of Seattle).

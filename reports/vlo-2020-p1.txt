our CEOIn 2020, we achieved several operational records, including best year ever for safety and environmental performance. In addition, we generated more than $58 million for charities through donations, fundraising and volunteerism. As many people suffered hardships, we focused our charitable contributions on providing food, shelter, educational resources, fuel and other life necessities.I am very proud of Team Valero. Throughout a year like no other, our employees showed their dedication to our company, and commitment to operating in an environmentally responsible and safe manner. I am proud of our efforts in diversity and inclusion, as those are strengths of our Valero team. As part of our pandemic response, we also expanded employee physical and mental health benefits, enhanced safety protocols and maintained high levels of communication with our workforce.  Looking to the future, we remain steadfast in our energy transition strategy. Valero is already a leader in the production of renewable fuels, with more than $3 billion invested. We expect to invest almost $2 billion over the next three years, expanding our board-approved low-carbon projects. In addition, we are evaluating and advancing investments in sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, carbon sequestration and more. We are on track to achieve our plan to reduce/offset 63% of global refining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025 through existing board-approved projects. And we are not stopping there. I am pleased to announce that we plan to increase that percentage to 100% by 2035. The management team and I recognize low-carbon fuels will be part of the energy mix. Demand for renewable fuels will be driven by low-carbon fuel policies and stricter fuel-efficiency standards. We plan to leverage our liquid-fuels platform and operational expertise to diversify into high-growth, high-return, lower-carbon projects going forward. Thank you for your continued support and trust. 4“We are on track Joe GorderCHAIRMAN AND

This helps make renewable diesel a viable solution to immediately reduce transportation GHG emissions without requiring a costly, time-intensive and CO2-emitting infrastructure build-out as with EVs.•	Our renewable diesel is typically made of waste materials and manufactured in jurisdictions with strict environmental, labor and governance regulations.•	Unlike with EVs, owners of vehicles running on renewable diesel do not incur a high up-front cost to replace their current vehicles, nor the expenses related to charging and other new infrastructure needed to support an EV. •	As detailed on the right, because of the feedstocks used to produce renewable diesel, a vehicle running on renewable diesel can significantly cut life cycle GHG emissions compared with an EV**. U.S. HEAVY-DUTY LONG-HAUL VEHICLE LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONSTons CO2 **Argonne National Laboratory (DOE) and Southwest Research Institute.

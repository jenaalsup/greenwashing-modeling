In 2020, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee approved a modification to our annual bonus program to also include ESG efforts and improvements, which contain multiple objectives.Operational Component, includes a HSE component weighted at 13.33%.Strategic Component, weighted at 20%, includes: ¥	ESG efforts and improvements (sustainability, environmental stewardship, diversity and inclusion, compliance and corporate citizenship/community).¥	Operational excellence (execution of capital projects, margin improvement and market expansion, and cost management and expense control).¥	Disciplined use of capital (balanced utilization of sustaining and growth capital vs. target).¥	Organizational excellence (innovation, public policy and leadership development).¥	Returns to stockholders (return cash to stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks).Long-term Incentive Program In 2021, our Human Resources and Compensation Committee strengthened the ties between executive compensation and ESG priorities through the addition of an energy transition modifier to our long-term incentive program, tying executive compensation with our publicly disclosed GHG emissions reduction/displacement target for 2025 and the deployment of capital to low-carbon projects and initiatives.Political 
Engagement We believe that constructive engagement in the political system serves the best interests of our stockholders, employees, neighbors and other stakeholders. In 2021, Valero enhanced its disclosures on political engagement, including board oversight, political participation and advocacy through trade associations. In addition, the company conducted a review of climate lobbying activities, which found that the relevant trade associations were substantially aligned with, or were in the process of aligning with, ValeroÕs vision of providing affordable and sustainable energy, while reducing GHG emissions. For more information on political engagement, visit our website at www.valero.com > Investors > ESG > Political Engagement.Stakeholder EngagementOur efforts to engage with stakeholders follow a Òreview, plan, engage and analyze and respondÓ cycle, with the following characteristics:
Proactive Ongoing engagement with stakeholders is important to us.

For instance, during the construction of the Diamond Pipeline in Oklahoma and Arkansas, 23 indigenous communities were contacted to participate in the permitting process. After a consultation process, more than 200 locations were identified to require tribal and archaeological surveying along the 440-mile route.NeighborsIn community engagement, our environmental justice policy has led our efforts aiming to treat our fence-line neighbors fairly, regardless of race, color, national origin, culture or income.

Government officials are invited to our refineries and plants to learn about our operations, products and contributions, and their impact on the communities. Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) Valero is committed to constructive dialogue with NGOs to better understand and address their concerns. For instance, as part the permitting of the coker project in our refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, we engaged with multiple NGOs in the area to provide them with details on this capital project, including the improvement of efficiency and the strengthening of the refinery to ensure economic development to the area for years to come. Industry and Business PartnersValero encourages responsible business development and works with industry and business partners to see that environmental, employee, social, health, governance and ethical concerns are addressed.Diversity search policies are in place that require that the initial list of candidates include diverse candidates for both board nominees and external searches for executive officers.

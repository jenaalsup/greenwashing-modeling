Sustainability Governance At MPC, our impacts, risks and opportunities related to economic, environmental and social topics are identified and managed at all levels under the leadership and guidance of our Board of Directors. The Board’s committees, including the Sustainability Committee, are responsible for specific areas of oversight and policy decision-making, as set forth in our Corporate Governance Principles and each committee’s charter. Our executive leadership team has primary responsibility for establishing and driving our sustainability strategies. The executive leadership team has established several cross-functional executive committees, which help ensure our objectives are incorporated into our OEMS standards and are cascaded throughout the organization. These standards are developed by committees of the executive leadership team and integrated with related procedures at the operational level. Communication and collaboration between the Board, its committees and management are critical to maintaining our aligned direction on sustainability matters. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY WITH INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY WITH INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY WITH INTEGRITY DATA Compliance and Ethics Our Board of Directors, executive leadership team and our thousands of employees know that exercising sound judgment and preserving our reputation for integrity are critical to our success. The cultivation and safeguarding of this commitment to responsible and ethical conduct throughout the organization is led by our chief compliance officer. Our Business Integrity Committee, chaired by the chief compliance officer and comprised of cross-functional members of executive leadership and senior management, promotes the effectiveness of our enterprise-wide Compliance and Ethics Program. MPC’s Code of Business Conduct requires that employees immediately report any suspected illegal or unethical conduct connected with the business of MPC or its affiliates. Legal Compliance We are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of our operations. With respect to our employees, we comply with legal requirements governing safety, workers’ rights and minimum wage, and equal employment opportunity. Our approach to environmental stewardship goes beyond compliance with evolving laws and regulations to include implementation of proactive initiatives to safeguard the environment and the communities where we live and work. We not only expect our employees to be knowledgeable about applicable legal requirements and act accordingly, we select contractors, suppliers and other business partners that demonstrate a similar commitment to legal and regulatory compliance. Code of Business Conduct We must obey the law, but we strive for an even higher standard. Operating with the highest standards of integrity is part of our culture at MPC and MPLX. Our Code of Business Conduct is framed by law, but most importantly it is based on the principle that we do the right thing. The Code defines expectations for ethical decision-making, accountability and responsibility for every employee at all levels of MPC, including those providing services to MPLX. Code Training and Certification We require Code of Business Conduct training and a new hire questionnaire for all MPC employees at hire. MPC salaried employees are required to complete an annual Code of Business Conduct certification. This includes a questionnaire and provides the opportunity for employees to disclose issues that could present a violation of the Code. Our business partners, including suppliers, consultants and contract workers, are expected to comply with the Code, as well as the law, and to support effective compliance programs in their own organizations. In 2020, we also announced a Supplier Code of Conduct. More information on our Supplier Code of Conduct can be found in the Our Suppliers section of this report on Page 50. AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY WITH INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY WITH INTEGRITY DATA AN OVERVIEW SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLE CONSERVING NATURAL CREATING PROMOTING OPERATING GLOSSARY PERFORMANCE AT MPC AND MPLX ENERGY RESOURCES SHARED VALUE SAFETY WITH INTEGRITY DATA Privacy MPC and our consolidated subsidiaries work to protect the personal data we receive. We are compliant with all applicable privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as all applicable privacy regulations, and safeguards, which have been applied to our operations across the country. Where required, MPC and Speedway adhere to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements to protect customers’ payment card account data, and we annually engage a third-party Qualified Security Assessor to complete an assessment of MPC and Speedway’s compliance. Political Contributions and Advocacy MPC participates in the political process in a number of ways, including lobbying, grassroots activity, issue advocacy, participation in trade associations, supporting Marathon Petroleum Corporation Employees Political Action Committee (MPAC)1, and, where lawful, direct support of political candidates and engagement on ballot issues that impact MPC and our industry. Our advocacy and contribution process is overseen by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors and senior management. All uses of company funds or resources to participate in the political process are made with the intent to promote the best interests of the company. Trade Associations MPC is active in trade associations and similar groups at the national, state and local levels. We believe participation in these associations is important to the company’s role as an industry leader and as an active member of the business communities in which we operate. These associations engage in many activities for the benefit of their members, including encouraging industry standards among member companies and advocating on issues that impact their respective members. Through our participation in trade associations, we seek to champion legislative solutions that are in the best interests of the company. We recognize that viewpoints of other trade association members may differ from our own. When this occurs, we seek to work with the association membership to promote reasonable compromise. However, we do not control the position that any trade association may take on any particular issue.

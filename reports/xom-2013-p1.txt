LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO “We strive to be responsible corporate citizens, and our success along that path is underpinned by our technological expertise, operational excellence, safety performance and unwavering ethical standards.” — Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman and CEO Welcome to the 2013 Corporate Citizenship Report. This report is an opportunity to reaffirm the commitments we make to our sharehold.ers, employees, customers and communities regarding our corporate citizenship perfor.mance. We strive to be responsible corporate citizens, and our success along that path is underpinned by our technological expertise, operational excellence, safety performance and unwavering ethical standards. Modern society consumes energy on a much wider and more complex scale than ever before. Over the coming decades, the world’s population is projected to rise from 7 billion to nearly 9 billion, and the global economy will more than double. As energy needs evolve, ExxonMobil will continue investing in the research and technology necessary to find, develop and deliver energy resources to our customers in the most efficient way possible. Working together with our stakeholders, we can help shape the landscape of energy consumption in the future. ECONOMIC GROWTH Access to energy is crucial to economic prosperity and human progress. In developing countries, it is fundamental to reducing pov.erty, improving health, increasing productivity, enhancing competitiveness and promoting long-term economic growth. Improving access to reliable and affordable energy in order to sustain and improve standards of living is the biggest and most impactful con.tribution we make to local communities and economies. But, our responsibility to society does not end there. Wherever we do business, we look to establish a skilled local workforce through aggressive recruitment and world-class training and development programs. We continued to make significant progress in hiring host coun.try workers in 2013. For example, in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia and Nigeria, we have established a national workforce that on average accounts for 83 percent of our workers. We also develop the capacity of and utilize local vendors to supply ExxonMobil with goods and services. Our goal is to help local communities and businesses fuel their econ.omies and positively contribute to long-term economic growth for generations to come. COMMITMENT TO SAFETY At ExxonMobil, our Operations Integrity Management System establishes common expectations for addressing safety, security, health, environmental and social risks. Our goal that Nobody Gets Hurt is more than just three words; it is a core value that drives us to be a successful business, a responsible employer and a good neighbor. In 2013, ExxonMobil was honored with the Green Cross for Safety® medal. Established in 2000, the U.S. National Safety Council awards the medal to an organization that exhibits safety leadership at all levels, boasts an outstanding safety record and is committed to improving the quality of life in the communities where its employees work and live. The commitment of our nearly 75,000 employees, as well as our third-party con.tractors, helped ExxonMobil continue to be among the industry leaders again in 2013. Compared with 2012, our workforce lost-time incident rate decreased by nearly 9 percent. Since the inclusion of XTO Energy in 2011, we have reduced our workforce lost-time incident rate by 45 percent. The unwavering dedi.cation of every worker allows for continual improvement — a goal always at the forefront of our safety culture. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Careful management of our environmental performance, through a focus on operational excellence, is an essential responsibility for our business. Our Operations Integrity Manage.ment System helps us align our environmental priorities with our business objectives and allows us to find new areas of opportunity to reduce environmental incidents. Spill prevention is a core component of ExxonMobil’s environmental performance. We continually seek to develop and improve risk management, operations integrity, spill prevention processes and containment capa.bilities, and, as a result, we had fewer spills in 2013 compared with 2012. As always, we welcome input from all of our stakeholders at exxonmobil.com/citizenship. Rex W.

By designing our approach to corporate citizenship around six key focus areas, we contribute to society’s broader sustainability objectives and manage the impact of our operations on local economies, societies and the environment. Key Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Issues: Challenges and Opportunities HUMAN RIGHTS AND MANAGING COMMUNITY IMPACTS Understanding and addressing the interests of societies and communities that may affect, or be affected by, our business is critical to our success. As our work continues to extend to remote locations, we must constantly find new ways to engage these stakeholders, identify priority issues and develop solutions that are beneficial for communities and our business. SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE WORKPLACE The safety and health of our workforce are at the core of our commitment to integrity. In 2013, we progressed toward our goal of Nobody Gets Hurt. However, we are still not where we need to be. We are focused on continuous improvement. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Our shareholders are varied, and each views our operations differently. We constructively engage with shareholders — including labor unions, religious organizations, state pension funds, socially responsible investors and institutional shareholders — to identify areas of opportunity and improvement. This engage.ment includes shareholder dialogues and our annual meeting. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT Ensuring a lasting, positive impact in the places where we do business is an ongoing focus. As supply chains become increasingly complex, we continually seek and develop relationships with suppliers that uphold our commitment to operational integrity and help us develop local capacity. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE It is important for the viability of our business that we understand the potential effects our business has on the local environment in the areas where we operate. We conduct impact assessments, stakeholder engagement and other due diligence to ensure we operate in a safe, respectful and environmentally protective manner. MANAGING CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS We manage our climate change risks by focusing on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through increased energy efficiency, enhanced operations at our facilities and technological innovation. As we work to reduce emissions, our challenge is to create solutions without undermining global economic growth. 2013 Corporate Citizenship Report exxonmobil.com MATERIALITY MATERIALITY A key step in developing this Corporate Citizenship Report is ensuring the content reflects ExxonMobil’s most material issues. According to the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), material issues for sustainability reporting are those that, in the view of both the company’s manage.ment and its external stakeholders, have the potential to significantly affect sustainability performance. We outline our materiality process to the right. 2013 Corporate Citizenship Report exxonmobil.com ENGAGEMENT ExxonMobil builds relationships with a diverse group of stakeholders through timely and transparent communica.tion. For a company of our size and scope, this is an ongoing challenge. Many people, organizations and communities are impacted directly by — and have a direct impact on — our business. Energy issues are complicated, and our stakeholders represent multiple viewpoints. The dialogue we develop with our stakeholders helps us understand all points of view and maintain a global perspective on our most material issues. This, in turn, helps us continue to improve our company and remain a responsible corporate citizen. We use a variety of mechanisms to engage our stakeholders, including:  Internal and external one-on-one and group dialogues and briefings  Senior executive speeches  Quarterly earnings teleconferences  Focus groups  Community consultations  Email communications  Twitter feeds  Corporate blog at exxonmobilperspectives.com  Publications such as the Corporate Citizenship Report, Summary Annual Report and our shareholder magazine, The Lamp, as well as community newsletters and content on our websites External Citizenship Advisory Panel Sarah Labowitz Co director of Center for Business and Human Rights The External Citizenship Advisory Panel (ECAP) — New York University Stern School comprising experts in social and environmental of Business topics — annually provides an independent review Joined ECAP in January 2014 of our corporate citizenship activities, including the Corporate Citizenship Report. View the panel’s statement on this report In 2013, the ECAP visited our Upstream Research Company in Houston, Texas, to discuss our approach to operating in the Arctic. The panelists also visited our headquarters in Dallas, Texas, to discuss how we measure and manage GHG emissions. Starting in 2014, two new members have joined the ECAP. Frank Loy is the former Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs at the U.S. Department of State, and Sarah Labowitz is the co-director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University’s Stern School of Business. We thank Elizabeth McGeveran and Tim Smith for sharing their perspectives with us as members of the panel from 2009 through 2013. 2013 Corporate Citizenship Report exxonmobil.com Our Stakeholders ENGAGEMENT MILLIONS OF  ~160,000 SUPPLIERS  ~75,000 EMPLOYEES  CUSTOMERS  of goods and services  in 64 countries around the world  including individual consumers and industrial customers  Approximately 160,000 suppliers throughout the world provide goods and services to our company to help ensure the continuity of our business. Engagement with suppliers in 2013 focused on expanding our supply chain in the areas where we work. 120 COUNTRIES in which we conduct business Our nearly 75,000 employees are the drivers for our contin.ued business success. We strive to foster an engaging work environment throughout our business. We have an ongoing dialogue with our employees about a wide range of issues, including benefits, development opportunities and diversity. 2.5 MILLION SHAREHOLDERS and more than 2,000 institutions ExxonMobil’s millions of customers range from consumers purchasing our lubricants and fuels to large-scale industrial customers of oil, natural gas and petrochemicals. We engage with customers about supply chain management, GHG emissions and the sustainability of our products across their life cycle, among other topics. 45,000 INDIVIDUALS in 530 interactive sessions ExxonMobil interacts with governments at all levels in the countries where we do business. In 2013, our discussions with government representatives focused on taxes, development of local suppliers, job creation, impact assessments, ethics, education and governance. More than 2.5 million individuals and 2,000 institutions invest in the continued success of our business. Through ongoing engagement, we discuss topics such as governance practices, board composition, policy engagement and sustainability. Community members, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academic institutions remain engaged in all phases of our business. In 2013, ExxonMobil held 530 interactive sessions with these groups to discuss topics ranging from biodiversity and climate change to community development and human rights. 2013 Corporate Citizenship Report exxonmobil.com ENERGY OUTLOOK Energy supply and demand are significant drivers of the global economy, and, as a key player in the energy market, we know that our actions have the power to improve lives. Technology and energy advances have helped bring about an unprecedented improvement in the key indicators of human well-being, including incomes, literacy rates and average life expectancy in many parts of the world. Going forward, we are challenged not only to meet basic needs, but also to improve living standards. For that reason, we update our long-term energy outlook each year — taking into account the most up-to-date demographic, economic, energy and technology information available. This analysis serves as a foundation for our business strategies and investments. The following are highlights from this year’s Outlook for Energy: sources, which will account for one-third of global produc.tion. During the same period, emerging sources such as oil sands, tight oil, deepwater, natural gas liquids and biofuels will account for more than 40 percent of global liquids supply, with tight oil supply growing more than 10 times — faster than any other liquid source. Advances in technol.ogies, such as those used for well drilling and completion, have enabled the energy industry to reach new sources of oil and natural gas, while helping to reduce the environmen.tal impact of energy production.  Worldwide electricity use is projected to increase by 90 percent from 2010 to 2040, with developing countries accounting for approximately 85 percent of the growth. With an increased trend of people moving from rural to urban areas, electricity will likely account for around  China and India will account for half of the projected growth in global energy demand through 2040. By then, nine of the world’s 20 most populous cities — and one of every three people on the planet — will be in these nations.  While oil will remain the fuel of choice for transportation, natural gas is emerging strongly as a growing fuel of choice for multiple sectors. It will be the world’s fastest-growing affecting people’s energy choices.

This means assessing performance at many levels of the organization, from our operational sites to the business lines. We provide data interpretations where we consider the performance trend to be generally desirable (), undesirable () or mixed () for applicable data. For certain metrics, no interpretation is necessary. For other metrics, we interpret trends Citizenship Data Table based on performance over a multiyear period and consider other factors in our assessments, such as production volumes and economic climate. We conduct much of this detailed analysis at the operational level. When we see unfavorable trends at any level, we identify them and aim to correct underlying causes. This report describes in detail our plan for addressing these issues.

Safety is a core value at ExxonMobil, and everyone has a common responsibility to identify, assess and mitigate risks in our operations. SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE WORKPLACE We view effective risk management and a commitment to safety as business imperatives. The safety and health of our employees, contractors and communities are at the core of our commitment to integrity. We will never stop working toward our goal of Nobody Gets Hurt. 2013 Corporate Citizenship Report exxonmobil.com Safety Safety is more than just a priority at ExxonMobil — it is a core value. Our safety performance in 2013 continued to be among the best in the industry. Regardless of an employee’s job function, all of us at ExxonMobil have a common responsibility in every assign.ment we undertake: identifying, assessing and mitigating the risks associated with our operations. The Valdez oil spill incident, which occurred 25 years ago this spring, was a turn.ing point in our history. In its aftermath, we launched a top-to-bottom review of our operations and then implemented our Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS), which guides the activities of each of our nearly 75,000 employees, as well as our third-party contractors. It is embedded in our everyday work processes at all levels, and we strive for con.tinuous improvement. Learn more about OIMS “Leaders establish the vision, communicate the core values including safety, provide the tools and resources, engage the workforce, monitor progress, adapt to change and recognize accomplishments. With the right leadership approach, you really can change the culture.” — Dan Egging, Sakhalin-1 Safety, Security, Health and Environment Manager Unfortunately, personnel and process safety incidents and near-misses do occur. When they do, we investigate what transpired, considering both the actual and potential consequences, to determine how to prevent similar incidents in the future. Many of our business lines use an in-house tool, called the Incident Risk Assessment Tool, to analyze the actual and potential consequences and the layers of protection in place to prevent the incident from having a more serious outcome. We then share each incident through Up Close: “Mining the Diamond” To continue improving our safety performance, we must dive deeper into safety incidents to understand their contributing factors. While the industry rate of total safety incidents has continued to decrease in recent years, the serious injury and fatality rate has not decreased at the same pace. Many oil and gas companies use a traditional safety pyramid to evaluate and think about safety incidents. The pyramid represents the actual outcome of events that have taken place — not taking into account the potential outcomes. Recognizing this challenge, ExxonMobil Development Company (EMDC) refers to this as a “diamond of knowledge” buried within the traditional pyramid, shown to the right. The diamond is a realization that on any given day, multiple incidents under different circumstances could have had a much more serious outcome. For example, when someone drops a wrench from the top of a drilling rig derrick, the outcome is typically a near-miss — an event that does not result in an illness, injury or fatality. However, a serious injury or fatality could have occurred if, for example, someone were standing in the wrong place. our global networks to ensure we implement those lessons in our operations around the world. A critical element of any comprehensive management system approach is honest and objective self-assessment. Without it, no system is sustainable. OIMS requires us to audit the health The “mining the diamond” approach recognizes these higher-risk activities and reacts to the potential outcomes of an incident, as well as the actual outcomes. For example, our Arctic Projects team at EMDC analyzed its safety incidents in a recent year and found only a small number of actual first aid or near-miss events — noted within the diamond below — could have reasonably resulted in a serious incident with a life-altering consequence. This analysis helped the project team focus on activities that had the potential for serious outcomes. DIAMOND ANALYSIS Fatalities Lost-time incidents Recordable incidents First aid or near-miss cases Actual recordable cases First aid or near-miss cases of our risk management approach regularly in each of our operating environments. These assessments are performed not only by qualified professionals, but also by cross-functional, cross-regional teams drawn from our global organization. In this way, all workers are responsible for each other’s safety. We are also continuing to improve the effectiveness of our “life-saving” practices, which we developed to reduce the Up Close: potential for the most severe injuries and fatalities. U.S. National Safety Council Honors ExxonMobil PERSONNEL SAFETY In 2013, we progressed toward our goal of Nobody Gets Hurt. When compared with 2012, our workforce lost-time incident rate decreased by nearly 9 percent. Since the inclusion of XTO Energy in 2011, we have reduced our workforce lost-time incident rate by 45 percent. However, we are still not where we want to be. We deeply regret that six workers were fatally injured in five incidents related to ExxonMobil operations in 2013. We have thoroughly investigated each of these incidents, determined the contributing factors and then identified steps to prevent similar events in the future. We do not believe safety management is proprietary. In collab.oration with other industry leaders, we are working to improve our understanding of ways to prevent fatalities and life-altering injuries more effectively. Watch our Sakhalin employees talk about     personal safety The expansion of our Singapore Chemical Plant set an industry-leading record in construction safety with more than 83 million hours worked without a lost-time injury. In addition, the construction of our new campus in Houston reached more than 7 million work-hours without a lost-time injury and an In 2013, the U.S. National Safety Council awarded ExxonMobil its prestigious Green Cross for Safety® medal “…in recognition of leadership and commitment to corporate and social responsibility efforts in safety.” The following is part of an interview with ExxonMobil’s Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson, that appeared in an issue of the Council’s Safety+Health magazine. Watch our Green Cross for Safety video View The Lamp 2013 #1 to read the full interview Why is safety a core value at Exxon Mobil Corporation? I’ve heard people say they’ve made safety a “top priority” for their company or organization. That’s commendable, but I believe that a commitment to safety must run much deeper than simply being a priority. Priorities can — and do — evolve over time, depending on business conditions and other factors. A commitment to safety, however, does not change or evolve. A commitment to safety is a value that shapes all decision-making at every level. What is the biggest obstacle to safety for Exxon Mobil Corporation, and how do you work to overcome it? The journey to safety excellence requires that we seek opportunities to continuously improve our approaches to the prevention of injuries and illnesses. In this regard, our analysis indicates that human factors continue to be primary contributors to incidents. We have learned that this, in part, has to do with the personal choices each of us makes to either accept or reject risk, or what we call “risk tolerance.” The concept of risk tolerance involves first recognizing or identifying the risk, understanding it, and lastly, making the choice to either accept or reduce the risk. It is in this last step, in particular, that we find significant opportunity. To facilitate progress in this area, we are continuing to reinforce the importance of workers looking out for each other in the workplace, encouraging and empowering people to intervene on behalf of others when faced with a potential at-risk situation. We refer to this as “actively caring.” Our focus is on training people to be more effective at inter.vention, as well as being intervened upon. Both of these — risk tolerance and actively caring — may sound very simple, but they represent some of the more perplexing challenges we face related to human factors in safety management. injury incidence rate one-fourth of the industry average for U.S. construction projects. This is particularly commendable given the scope of the work, with more than 20 buildings in various phases of construction and up to 4,500 workers on site every day. ExxonMobil plans to share lessons learned and incorporate best practices at our facilities and projects around the world. ExxonMobil merged with XTO Energy in 2010, and since that time we have worked together to implement improved safety standards in the organization. XTO Energy safety performance improved in 2013 compared with 2012. XTO Energy continues to implement OIMS and is committed to continuous improve.ment. In 2013, XTO Energy completed training front-line supervisors, superintendents and engineering managers in safety leadership, enabling them to promote behavior-based safety principles and techniques. TOTAL RECORDABLE INCIDENT RATE1 (incidents per 200,000 work hours) ExxonMobil employees ExxonMobil contractors American Petroleum Institute U.S. petroleum industry employee benchmark 0.6 0.3 PROCESS SAFETY Process safety refers to equipment, procedures and training that prevent the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons and hazardous substances. Our goal is to prevent incidents with the potential for serious injuries and fatalities, widespread environmental impact or property damage. Recent industry events have further reinforced ExxonMobil’s long-standing resolve to excel in process safety management. We subscribe to the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice 754 and International Association of Oil & Gas Producers No. 456, which are industry standards. These standards define process safety indicators and use a process safety incident triangle to represent events from Tier 1 through Tier 4. Tiers 1 and 2 represent incidents resulting in a loss of primary containment. According to the API, loss of primary containment is defined as an unplanned or LOST-TIME INCIDENT RATE1 (incidents per 200,000 work hours) ExxonMobil employees ExxonMobil contractors American Petroleum Institute U.S. petroleum industry employee benchmark 0.2 0.1 uncontrolled release of any material from primary contain.ment, including nontoxic and nonflammable materials. Tiers 3 and 4 represent near-misses and leading performance measures such as on-time maintenance performance. During 2013, we had 61 Tier-1 process safety events. After careful analysis, we determined human factors, procedures and preventive maintenance were the primary contributing elements to the occurrence of these events, allowing us to develop and enhance prevention strategies more effectively. ExxonMobil serves as a contributing member to a variety of groups and initiatives focused on improving safety in the industry. For example, we contribute to the Advancing Process Safety Initiative, a collaborative effort between the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the API. The goal of this initiative is to improve process safety performance across the industry, and nearly all of the refining capacity in the United States is represented in this initiative. The program creates more opportunities to communicate and share expe.riences and knowledge about process safety events, hazard identification and performance metrics, and industry-proven practices. This effort recognizes that when a significant process safety event occurs at any site, large or small, it affects every.one in the industry by eroding stakeholder trust.

Safety data are based on information available at the time of publication. emergency contact information. Due to the evolving nature of regulatory requirements, we continually monitor developments to ensure our products comply with regulations. With regard to our products, we follow guidelines and regulations that include:  United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)  Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)  United Nations Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM)  Clean fuel standards in the United States and European Union View page 40 of our 2012 Corporate Citizenship Report for more information on these guidelines Workplace Security We are constantly assessing potential threats to our people, physical assets and intellectual property. Security is deeply embedded into our day-to-day operations. We have developed consistent worldwide security practices and have appointed and trained site-security contacts to meet challenges in the diverse locations where we operate. Each new facility goes through a security analysis that takes into account potential risks, the application of countermeasures, relationships with communities and compliance with appli.cable laws. Our security personnel regularly participate in governmental and industry forums to enhance our established risk-management methodologies, threat-assessment capa.bilities and technical security applications. In higher-threat locations, we monitor local conditions and maintain detailed security preparedness plans. As information technology continues to evolve, cyber.attacks present a greater risk to the safety and security of ExxonMobil’s data, facilities and ongoing business oper.ations. On average, our cybersecurity screening programs block more than 80 million emails, 90 million Internet access attempts and 30,000 other potentially malicious actions each month. In addition, we have trained all of our employees and contractors on how to identify and respond to potential cyber.security situations. Emergency Preparedness and Response An important aspect of our business is the ability to respond to emergencies as soon as they arise. ExxonMobil conducts extensive training and drills in preparation for such situations. Effective emergency preparedness depends on competent response teams. To develop and practice emergency response strategies and to relieve the burden on field responders, we establish strategic Emergency Support Groups (ESGs) consist.ing of a wide range of ExxonMobil employees. We routinely train these groups on a range of possible scenarios, including simulated spills, fires, explosions, natural disasters and security Up Close: Regional Response Teams ExxonMobil’s emergency preparedness and response model builds on a foundation of rapid and comprehensive response. Regardless of the size of an incident, each ExxonMobil facility and business unit has access to a wide array of trained respond.ers, including, but not limited to, Regional Response Teams (RRTs). Our three RRTs — North America; Europe, Africa, Middle East; and Asia Pacific — comprise approximately 450 ExxonMobil personnel trained on one consistent system with common roles and responsibilities. They provide rapid response support, as well as professional support and assistance, when needed. Emergency response requires a disciplined command and control approach based on clear communication. In total, the RRTs completed six training exercises in 2013, with approximately 350 ExxonMobil participants and more than 200 external responders. As an example, our North America RRT conducted an exercise in San Francisco in 2013 in which more than 100 employees, along with approximately 150 regulatory agency members and contractors, participated. This exercise simulated a major spill of 148,000 barrels of Alaska North Slope crude off the coast of San Francisco. The major objectives of this training included validating and identifying areas for potential enhancement of response capability for hypothetical vessel spills offshore San Francisco, and building working relationships with key fed.eral, state and local stakeholders. The exercise was successful in achieving its objectives, and we continue to share lessons learned with other RRT members. The North America RRT also responded to the Mayflower, Arkansas, incident in 2013. For more information, see page 33. incidents. In 2013, an estimated 750 ExxonMobil employees participated in approximately 50 ESG training classes. Every site also conducts emergency drills in accordance with regulatory requirements and OIMS guidelines. Site response teams are supplemented with Emergency Response Strike Teams and RRTs, as needed. Both site and supplemental emergency response personnel train and exercise together on a regular basis. Our specialized three-day training program, which includes two days of classroom sessions and a day of outdoor hands-on training using oil spill response equipment, gives employees the skills they need to plan for and carry out a response using an Incident Command System structure. In 2013, we held 15 training classes around the globe, and approx.imately 250 ExxonMobil employees participated. Our training sessions in 2013 focused on recent advancements in emergency response, such as subsea injection of dispersants and enhanced shoreline cleanup assessments. We operate in some countries that do not have clear emergency response requirements, and in those cases, we apply global good prac.tices to determine the frequency of emergency drills. Health and Wellness ExxonMobil supports programs and services that help our employees live healthier lives. INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL We operate in a variety of countries throughout the world, and each location has its own health challenges. Some locations expose our workforce and their families to higher infectious disease risks. We have established a structured program for infectious disease control to monitor and address related issues. As part of this program, a multiyear plan was developed that focuses on implementing programs in locations with a significant threat of malaria and other vector-borne diseases, infectious outbreaks, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Our workplace HIV/AIDS program, StopAIDS, combines educational programs with access to community-based care and treatment for those affected by HIV. ExxonMobil does not test for HIV, nor is HIV status a factor in determining an employee’s ability to work. However, ExxonMobil encourages voluntary counseling and testing conducted by community providers. The recently developed infectious disease outbreak man.agement program for offshore sites and camps successfully reduced the spread of infections like norovirus to less than 5 percent of workers in affected sites. The program is now being adopted as a best practice by others within the oil and gas industry. Malaria is a significant concern at our operations in Africa and parts of Asia Pacific. Our Malaria Control Program covers both employees and contractors working in malaria-endemic countries. In 2013, 18 malaria cases were reported — compared with 203 in 2002 before the program matured — out of the thousands of our non-immune workers located in or visiting endemic areas. In the past 10 years, we estimate our work.place Malaria Control Program has averted 1,800 malaria cases among non-immune workers. For more information about our efforts to eradicate malaria in the communities where we operate, see page 69. PREVENTIVE CARE Investing in preventive health care is an effective way of reducing the incidence of chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, respiratory ailments, cancer and depression. ExxonMobil’s Culture of Health is our U.S. site-based pre.ventive health and wellness program. This program includes resources for employees and family members to achieve personal health goals. In 2013, quarterly seminars focused on healthy food choices, fitness, stress management and quality sleep. A monthly awareness campaign highlighted employees who used the program tools and resources to make healthy lifestyle behavior changes. Outside the United States, we are piloting culturally relevant programs within the context of different health care systems, health needs and available resources in the countries where we have offices and operations. The benefits plans we offer comply with or exceed applicable country laws or regulations, including requirements mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States. Workforce ExxonMobil’s nearly 75,000 employees contribute to the success of our business; we are committed to contributing to their career goals and professional development. Our employees are our greatest asset, and we seek to foster a diverse workforce of highly talented individuals committed to achieving our business priorities. We use a long-term, career-oriented approach that includes recruiting outstanding talent and developing individuals internally by providing them the opportunity to complete a wide range of assignments. EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND POLICIES ExxonMobil has operations around the world, and we foster the ideas, perspectives, skills, knowledge and cultures of our diverse employees. We also sponsor a range of programs, activities and investments to create, develop and maintain a diverse workforce that represents the broad geographies where we do business. Our Global Diversity Framework is the foundation for our long-term, career-oriented approach to employment, with three interrelated objectives: attract, develop and retain a premier, diverse workforce; actively foster a productive work environment where individual and cultural differences are respected and valued; and identify and develop leadership capabilities to excel in a global environment. We use a series of Web-based trainings and tools to support this framework and help our employees understand effective cross-cultural communication and cultural sensitivities. Our Standards of Business Conduct govern all aspects of our employment, including recruitment, hiring, work assignments, promotions, transfers, terminations, wage and salary admin.istration, and selection for training. Our Standards support our commitment to equal employment opportunities, prohibit harassment and discrimination in the workplace, and align with applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. We strictly prohibit any form of discrimination by or toward employees, contractors, suppliers or customers in any ExxonMobil working environment. View our Standards of Business Conduct Our global zero-tolerance policy applies to all forms of discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Harassment, even in its most subtle forms, directly conflicts with company policy and is not tolerated. Every employee is subject to disciplinary action, including termination, for any act of harassment. We employ a comprehensive education, training and stewardship program to ensure employees worldwide understand, implement and follow our antiharassment policy. We provide training on the Standards of Business Conduct for new employees and offer refresher courses to existing employees on a regular basis. Our annual reporting and compliance procedures include a letter to senior managers emphasizing their responsibility to maintain work environments free from harassment and discrimination. Each affiliate has adopted ExxonMobil’s global standards, with modifications only as needed to comply with country laws. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION We support local employee networks around the world to foster a work environment dedicated to diversity and inclusion. These include the Asian Connection for Excellence (ACE); Black Employee Success Team (BEST); Global Organization for the Advancement of Latinos (GOAL); People for Respect, Inclusion and Diversity of Employees (PRIDE); and Women’s Interest Net.work (WIN). These groups facilitate professional development programs, sponsor educational and community service programs to raise cultural awareness, and actively mentor new employees. Regarding the importance of leveraging employee networks: “It speeds assimilation and builds confidence. Our company culture embraces diversity and encourages networking, which builds breadth, depth and relationships.” — Tony Lewis, Global Marketing and Growth Manager,     ExxonMobil Chemical, Houston, Texas Our comprehensive diversity and inclusion efforts also include educational partnerships and supplier diversity initiatives designed to improve the quality of life where we live and work. We support diversity-based education programs such as the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, among others. We believe these strategic investments in education will help build a global pool of talent in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields to support further development of the oil and gas industry.

We retain and develop our employees by fostering an environment where personal and professional growth is encouraged, and career objectives are developed and achieved. During the annual performance assessment and development process, every employee has a structured, documented discussion with their supervisors about work accomplishments, training objectives, develop.ment opportunities and career interests. This process provides the basis for ongoing employee coaching and continuous performance improvement. The company’s training programs, mentorships and networking opportunities also help employ.ees grow and develop throughout their time at ExxonMobil. TRAINING EXPENDITURES AND NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES TRAINED Spending (millions of dollars) Employees trained (non-unique participants) 2010 2011 2012 2013  $77 $80 $88 $96  2010 2011 2012 2013  61,000 65,000 76,000 87,000  Another aspect of our retention and engagement strategy involves providing a robust corporate and technical training program. Our major business units spent $96 million on training employees in 2013, reaching more than 87,000 non-unique training participants. To maintain our position as a technical leader in the industry, we directed more than 71 percent of our investment toward professional technical training. Additionally, more than 3,900 employees at various levels of the company participated in ExxonMobil’s leader.ship development training programs in 2013, of which 30 percent were women and 59 percent were employees outside the United States. Our workplace flexibility programs assist in maintaining employee engagement by addressing individual employee needs and maximizing employee productivity. ExxonMobil offers a variety of workplace flexibility programs, which may be customized and used individually or in combination to meet individual needs.

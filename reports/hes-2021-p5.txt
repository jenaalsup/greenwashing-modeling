Climate Change and Energy To help quantify climate related risks and opportunities Ð and to provide Considerations for Carbon Risk Scenario Assessment perspectives to our investors and other key stakeholders on how HessÕ oil and gas portfolio might be impacted by a transition to a lower carbon economy Ð Hess conducts an annual scenario planning exercise to assess portfolio resilience over the longer term. This scenario based approach allows us to assess and communicate to our shareholders our understanding of future risks and opportunities in relation to the potential evolution of energy demand, energy mix, the emergence of new technologies and possible changes by policymakers with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. In accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial DisclosuresÕ (TCFD's) recommended transparency around key parameters, assumptions and analytical choices, Hess has chosen to model the four key scenarios detailed in the International Energy AgencyÕs (IEA's) 2021 World Energy Outlook (WEO) against our own internal base planning case. The TCFD recommends that organizations use a scenario under which global warming is kept to well below a 2¡C increase during this century, compared with preindustrial levels, to test portfolio resilience. Such scenarios usually feature a reduction in demand for oil, natural gas and coal and a growth in clean technologies. The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) in the IEAÕs 2021 WEO, which are part of HessÕ modeling, fit with this recommendation. To evaluate the potential exposure of our portfolio in a carbon constrained future, we began by considering the long range outlook for energy supply and demand, as well as for oil, natural gas and carbon prices. We have used the IEAÕs 2021 WEO to examine supply and demand and oil, natural gas and carbon price scenarios through 2050 in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), SDS and NZE (see iea.org/reports/world-energy.outlook-2021). These scenarios are recognized as a leading industry standard and benchmark worldwide and are, therefore, an appropriate choice for an oil and gas producer such as Hess. An important consideration when reviewing the results of our analysis is that the SDS and NZE are considered reverse engineered or Ònormative forecasts,Ó meaning they are designed to achieve a specific outcome, and the pathway to reach that outcome may be a narrow one. For example, over 50% of the reductions needed to achieve the NZE come from technologies that are currently in the demonstration or prototype stage, meaning they are not readily available on the market. The two other IEA scenarios used in our modeling, STEPS and APS, define a set of starting conditions and then project a path forward based on those conditions. Additionally, according to the IEA, the scenarios in the WEO are designed to Òdescribe a smooth, orderly process of change,Ó while in practice, Òenergy transitions can be volatile and disjointed affairsÓ (2021 WEO, page 68). The charts below depict the 2021 WEOÕs world energy supply and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions under the IEAÕs four key scenarios. Stated Policies Scenario Announced Pledges Scenario 20 4020 40 15 3015 30 10 2010 20 5 105 10 0 00 0 2010 2017 2019 2020 2030 2040 2050 2010 2017 2019 2020 2030 2040 2050 Sustainable Development Scenario Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario Billion Tons of Oil Equivalent Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide Billion Tons of Oil Equivalent 20 4020 40 15 3015 30 10 2010 20 5 105 10 0 00 0 2010 2017 2019 2020 2030 2040 2050 2010 2017 2019 2020 2030 2040 2050 ÷ Other Renewables ÷ Bioenergy ÷ Hydrogen ÷ Nuclear ÷ Natural Gas ÷ Oil ÷ Coal CO2 equivalent Climate Change and Energy In STEPS, which is consistent with enacted energy policies and a pragmatic view of proposed policies, worldwide energy supply is expected to grow by approximately 21% between 2019 and 2050. While there is a decline in supply for coal in this scenario, between 2019 and 2050, oil and natural gas are expected to grow by 6% and 24%, respectively, and account for approximately 50% of the energy mix in 2050. In APS, worldwide energy supply is expected to grow by approximately 10% between 2019 and 2050, while oil and natural gas supply are expected to decline by approximately 21% and 6%, respectively. However, even with this decline, oil and natural gas supply still represent over 42% of the total energy mix in 2050. In the SDS, worldwide energy supply is projected to experience a moderate decline of approximately 6% between 2019 and 2050. Oil and natural gas supply are projected to decrease by 47% during that same time frame, accounting for approximately 30% of the energy mix in 2050. The IEA acknowledges that society is not on the NZE pathway. In the NZE, worldwide energy supply is projected to essentially remain flat between 2019 and 2050. This scenario, which is a normative forecast, is designed ¥ The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) takes into account implementing measures affecting energy markets that have already been adopted, chiefly the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) Ð the emissions reductions agreed to by individual countries under the Paris Agreement. Essentially, the STEPS shows how the energy system might progress without additional steer from policymakers. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that implementing the STEPS will result in an increase in global average temperatures of 2.6¡C in 2100 compared with preindustrial levels. ¥ The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes all climate commitments made by governments worldwide will be met in full and on time including NDCs and net zero targets. The IEA estimates that implementing the APS will result in an increase in global average temperatures of 2.1¡C in 2100 compared with preindustrial levels. to drive a specific outcome. In 2050, renewables are projected to account for approximately 67% of the total energy mix, while oil and natural gas are projected to account for approximately 20% of the energy mix. Oil and Gas Investment in IEAÕs 2021 Scenarios Annual upstream oil and gas investment is assumed to be significantly higher in the STEPS and APS during 2021Ð2050 and in the NZE during 2021Ð2030, when compared with 2020, in order to meet energy supply requirements (see the IEA table below, left). HessÕ Approach to Scenario Planning The TCFD recommends that once a less than 2¡C scenario is established, companies should define a base case or business as usual outlook for the future. The base case should use the same set of metrics as the less than 2¡C scenario (e.g., oil demand, carbon prices and other market factors) and share the same fundamental economic foundations. Establishing multiple scenarios allows for measurement of the delta between metrics at future points to properly understand the envelope within which risk and opportunity may occur. HessÕ approach to scenario planning is aligned with the TCFD recommendations. We have prepared internal guidance that details our approach and establishes a specified methodology. This also serves as a roadmap for our external verifier to review and verify that we followed our specified methodology when conducting this scenario analysis. Our first step in this process was to establish a Hess base case, which for 2022 was premised off a $65 per barrel Brent oil price through 2050 and a $3.50 per million British thermal units Henry Hub natural gas price through 2050; both cost bases are in 2022 real terms. In addition, in the base case, we applied either actual carbon pricing for our assets and intended forward investments (where a regulatory framework for such exists) or used a carbon price of $40 per tonne through 2050 for other geographies. HessÕ base case was then compared against the various oil, natural gas and carbon prices in the IEAÕs four key scenarios Ð STEPS, APS, SDS and ¥ The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) reflects a pathway to achieving key energy related components of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda Ð including universal access to modern energy by 2030, urgent action to tackle climate change and measures to improve poor air quality. The SDS represents a gateway to achieve the aim of the Paris Agreement, with a 50% probability of limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.65¡C in 2100 and assumptions that advanced economies achieve net zero emissions by 2050, China by 2060 and all other countries by 2070 at the latest. If negative emissions technologies were to be deployed after 2070, the temperature rise in 2100 could be limited to 1.5¡C with a 50% probability. ¥ The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario reflects a narrow pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, consistent with limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5¡C in 2100 with a 50% probability. Climate Change and Energy NZE Ð running our current asset portfolio and intended forward investments through these varying sets of assumptions to assess financial robustness. The charts below show the oil and natural gas prices, as well as CO2 prices in advanced economies, under the IEAÕs STEPS, APS, SDS and NZE against HessÕ base case. Please note that the IEAÕs oil, natural gas and CO2 prices have been adjusted to 2022 real terms to be comparable to HessÕ base case price assumptions. As these charts show, there is a wide spread of oil, natural gas and carbon pricing across the four IEA scenarios, a key component of informed scenario planning. Results of the Hess Scenario Planning Exercise Through our methodology, we have tested the robustness of HessÕ asset portfolio and intended forward investments under multiple energy supply and demand scenarios, including the IEAÕs STEPS, APS, SDS and NZE. In discussing potential financial implications, the TCFD does not ask organizations to provide a financial forecast (for which scenario analysis is not appropriate). Organizations are asked to provide an indication of direction or ranges of potential financial implications. While we do not publish quantitative financial results due to their confidential nature, we are providing a range of potential financial implications from the various IEA scenarios, as detailed below. Crude Oil Price Natural Gas Price CO2 Price, Advanced Economies 100 6 280 240  DoU.S.llars per Barrel 4 200 160 120 2 80 40 000 2022 2027 2032 2037 2042 2047 2050 2022 2027 2032 2037 2042 2047 2050 .

HessÕ strategic priorities, which uniquely position us to deliver long term value, are to deliver (1) high return resource growth, (2) a low cost of supply and (3) industry leading cash flow growth. This strategy is consistent with the IEAÕs less than 2¡C scenarios, which envision a meaningful role for oil and natural gas through 2050. Hess plans to allocate the majority of our capital expenditures to developing the companyÕs assets offshore Guyana and in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Our offshore oil discoveries in Guyana are among the industryÕs largest discoveries made globally over the last decade, with more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent recoverable reserves. Our four sanctioned developments Ð Liza Phase 1, Liza Phase 2, Payara and Yellowtail Ð have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. According to a study by Wood Mackenzie (as illustrated below), Guyana is one of the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil developments globally. In the Bakken, Hess has approximately 800 and 1,600 locations at $40 per barrel and $50 per barrel West Texas Intermediate (WTI), respectively, that can generate at least a 15% internal rate of return. That equates to greater than 27 to 53 rig years for the company, assuming one rig drills 30 wells per year, as illustrated at right. We expect that GuyanaÕs low breakeven costs, along with aggressive cost reduction activities in the Bakken, will contribute substantially to structurally lowering our portfolio breakeven costs to less than $45 per barrel Brent oil by 2026. Notably, this is lower than the oil price assumption through 2030 in the STEPS, APS and SDS. As a result, Hess is well positioned to retain our share in the marketplace as a low cost producer, even with the gradually reducing global oil demand projected under the IEAÕs various scenarios. In summary, based on the results of our 2022 scenario planning analysis, we conclude that we can produce our current reserve base and deliver strong performance under the STEPS, APS and SDS and produce the majority of our current reserve base under the NZE. Gross Number of Economic Locations at Various WTI Prices* 2,500 2,300 2,200 2,100 2,000 1,600 1,500 1,000 800 500 0 WTI: $40/BBL $50/BBL $60/BBL $70/BBL $80/BBL Rig-Years:* ~27 ~53 ~70 ~73 ~77 *Point forwardJanuary 2022, locations generating higher than 15% after tax return.

We use short term targets as a stepwise approach to meeting these objectives. In 2021, we set an AIP compensation target to achieve a 7% flaring rate from Bakken wells and pads, as reported to the NDIC. This target was more aggressive than the 9% flaring rate We have established a GHG intensity reduction target for the end of 2025, which we consider to be medium term. Our target is to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of our operated assets to 17 kilograms (kg) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) by 2025 versus a 2017 baseline of 34 kg CO2e per BOE. This GHG reduction target utilizes a market based approach to GHG accounting, which allows the use of market based instruments such as RECs to mitigate the environmental impact of Scope 2 GHG emissions. Our location based GHG emissions can be found in the Performance Data table on page 67. Note: Denmark emissions are excluded from this chart because they are excluded from our 2025 target. Through 2021, we have reduced our GHG emissions intensity to 18 kg CO2e per BOE or by approximately 47% compared with our 2017 baseline of 34 kg CO2e per BOE as shown on the chart above. We aligned this GHG intensity reduction target with the IEAÕs 2021 World Energy Outlook SDS and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), as illustrated in the chart below. The 21% carbon intensity reduction between 2017 and 2030 in the SDS is consistent with a well below 2¡C ambition, whereas the NZE suggests a 36% reduction during that time frame required by the NDIC at the time.

These IEA carbon intensity reduction figures are derived using the IEAÕs SDS and NZE CO2 emissions divided by their worldwide energy supply estimate in 2030 versus 2017 actuals. HessÕ GHG intensity reduction target is based on our operated Scope 1 and 2 market based GHG emissions normalized by production. The Hess target results in a 50% GHG intensity reduction between 2017 and 2025, which is more aggressive than the IEA SDSÕ 21% and NZEÕs 36% emissions intensity reductions by 2030. This target is also designed to place us in a leadership position for emissions performance among our peers in the oil and gas industry, based on current publicly available data. Flaring Hess has recently endorsed the World BankÕs Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) ZRF. GGFR advocates for ending routine gas flaring by garnering commitments from oil and gas companies to end routine flaring by 2030. GGFR defines routine flaring as Òflaring that occurs during the normal production of oil, Midstream, we continue to focus on the buildout of gas infrastructure in the Bakken and consider additional flare reduction initiatives globally. (See page 54 for further detail on these initiatives.) Methane While natural gas continues to play a critical role in the transition to a low carbon economy, there remains debate about fugitive methane leakage along the natural gas value chain and whether that may have the potential to reduce this fuelÕs climate benefits. Hess supports the Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, which was announced by the U.S. and European Union at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland. Hess also supports the enactment of cost effective direct methane regulations that would preserve a stateÕs ability to adapt implementation to local conditions. In late 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a rule to expand and strengthen methane reduction requirements. We are in the process of reviewing the EPAÕs proposed regulation and welcome continued engagement with the agency to help develop a final rule that encourages significant methane emissions reductions while also providing producers with the flexibility needed to continue supplying reliable and affordable energy to consumers. medium term target to reduce operated methane emissions intensity to 0.19% by 2025, which equates to an over 50% reduction in methane emissions intensity versus our 2017 baseline. As of year end 2021, we have achieved a methane intensity rate of 0.18%, as shown at left, surpassing our 2025 target. We attribute this result to a combination of our continued efforts to reduce methane emissions, which include increasing natural gas capture, reducing flaring, continuing our leak detection and repair (LDAR) program, and replacing and retrofitting the remaining high bleed pneumatic controllers in our North Dakota operations. An additional factor is the updating of our calculation methodology, so that we remain in line with industry standards. While we aim to maintain this performance in support of our year end 2025 target, we are in the process of reevaluating the target to determine if it should be adjusted. Renewable Energy A component of both our short and medium term strategy is to purchase renewable energy and/or carbon offsets to mitigate 100% of our Scope 2 GHG emissions. We are currently implementing this strategy by purchasing RECs. However, we are also exploring various options for securing renewable and/or carbon neutral energy in the future. Climate Change and Energy Long Term Climate Related Emissions Reduction Targets (2032+) We believe considerations for our long term strategy (10+ years) are primarily related to changes in energy supply and demand and related policies as well as the emergence of new technologies that could alter the composition of HessÕ overall portfolio. In late 2020, we established an executive led task force to develop a net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions plan. We expect that our short and medium term commitments, including reducing GHG and methane emissions intensity, eliminating routine flaring and purchasing renewable energy, will help us mitigate a significant portion of our current Scope 1 and 2 emissions profile. While we believe that the shorter term strategic actions we are implementing will continue to be viable beyond a 10 year time frame, we are also examining additional opportunities to address our GHG emissions in the long term. These include increased energy efficiency from electrification of our operations and deployment of advanced technologies that are not currently commercially viable or are still in development, in combination with the purchase of high quality carbon offsets to address the residual Scope 1 and 2 emissions that are difficult to mitigate with direct reductions. We are in the early stages of refining this long term plan and will continue to provide updates on its progress. With regard to Scope 3, we are committed to transparency on our emissions and have reported our estimated Scope 3 carbon footprint for many years. We believe Scope 3 is a societal issue and needs to be addressed in a different manner from our own Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint. Hess supports a carbon price to encourage the investments needed to accelerate decarbonization across all sectors of the economy while keeping energy affordable. We believe that a market based mechanism will drive innovation for new technologies and lead to a more efficient end use of hydrocarbon products. A policy that puts a price on carbon should ensure uniform cost of GHG emissions on a CO2e basis throughout the global economy and should address key pricing risks, such as carbon leakage, energy affordability and policy durability, and equity issues such as regressive impacts on underdeveloped communities. In addition, we are focusing on scientific solutions and innovative research with the potential to address GHG emissions on a global scale. Our support of groundbreaking research on plant based carbon capture and storage by the Salk Institute is described in more detail on page 53. GHG PERFORMANCE We report GHG emissions from our oil and gas assets on both operated and equity bases. Additionally, while our short and medium term GHG emissions reduction targets utilize a market based approach to GHG accounting, we report these operated GHG emissions on both a location and market basis. Our GHG emissions estimates include CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, which are reported in units of CO2e. In 2014, Hess began using global warming potentials based on the values in the Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007, prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to estimate CO2e totals. Approximately 93% of HessÕ direct reported (Scope 1) operated GHG emissions are from stationary combustion sources such as flares, heaters, turbines and engines. The factors used to estimate emissions for these sources enterprisewide are those prescribed by the EPA in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart C). The remaining 7% of our reported operated GHG emissions are from a variety of noncombustion and fugitive emissions sources, such as storage tanks, compressor seals, pneumatic pumps and valves. For such sources at onshore facilities, we use the emissions factors prescribed by the EPA in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W). Hess uses other appropriate regulatory or industry specific factors to estimate fugitive emissions for all other facilities. We also report indirect emissions associated with purchased electricity (Scope 2) and other indirect (Scope 3) emissions. See additional reporting indicators in our response to the American Petroleum Institute Template for GHG Reporting at hess.com/ sustainability/climate-change-energy Baseline Review and Restatements We continuously look for opportunities to improve our GHG data collection efforts and calculation methodologies, and have made a number of restatements in the performance data within this report, as follows: ¥ Through analysis of our historical GHG emissions inventories, we have identified certain emissions sources previously designated as not material to our overall emissions profile, including emissions from our North Dakota truck fleet and office electricity use, which have now been incorporated into our annual inventories for 2017Ð2020. We have also been working to fine-tune the activity data used for our emissions calculations, such as applying adjusted run times for the heater treaters used at our operated wellsites. ¥ We have made some enhancements to our Scope 3 emissions calculations as described on page 53. After establishing our new five year GHG reduction target with a 2017 baseline, we engaged our third party sustainability data verifier to conduct an additional verification of our 2017 GHG inventory at the reasonable assurance level. Based on this exercise, we were able to validate our 2017 GHG inventory. Another important data consideration is related to the sale of our interests in Denmark in August 2021. As the sale was announced in early 2021, we excluded Denmark when establishing the 2017 2.9 Million Tonnes CO2e ÷ Flaring ÷ Natural Gas Combustion ÷ Purchased Electricity (Scope 2) ÷ Fugitives ÷ Liquid Fuel Combustion Note: The ßaring total above includes 184 tonnes of CO2e emissions from venting. Million Tonnes CO2e 5 4.34.1 4 3 2 1 0 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 ÷ U.S. ÷ Divested Assets ÷ Denmark* ÷ Malaysia *Divested in August 2021. Million Tonnes CO2e 5 4.3 4.3 4.0 3.8 3.84 3 2 1 0 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 ÷ Denmark* ÷ Malaysia ÷ Divested Assets ÷ Malaysia/Thailand ÷ Guyana ÷ U.S. ÷ Libya *Divested in August 2021. baseline year data for our new GHG and methane emissions intensity targets (that were also announced last year). However, because Hess operated the asset through August 2021, we have included Denmark in our 2021 absolute GHG emissions data discussed in the following subsections. Operated Emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) In 2021, of the estimated 2.9 million tonnes of gross GHG emissions reported from our operated oil and gas assets, 2.5 million tonnes were Scope 1 emissions, primarily from flaring and fuel combustion, and approximately 0.4 million tonnes were Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity. Process operations (primarily fuel combustion) and flaring each accounted for approximately 40% of our combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. In 2021, our absolute GHG emissions decreased by 0.7 million tonnes compared with 2020, due primarily to a significant reduction in natural gas flaring in North Dakota associated with aggressive expansion of Hess MidstreamÕs natural gas gathering, compression and processing infrastructure. On a market basis, our cumulative GHG emissions intensity through 2021 (i.e., tonnes of emissions per thousand BOE) decreased by 47% compared with our 2017 baseline. Equity Emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Since 2007, Hess has tracked GHG emissions from our operated and nonoperated oil and gas assets based on our equity interest. The graphs on pages 52Ð53 detail our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from 2017 to 2021 on an equity basis. These graphs show that over the past five years, our absolute Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions have decreased by 0.2 million tonnes to approximately 3.8 million tonnes of CO2e. During the same period, estimated Scope 3 equity emissions decreased by 0.3 million tonnes to approximately 43 million tonnes of CO2e. Scope 1 and 2 Equity Emissions Our major source of Scope 1 and 2 emissions from nonoperated oil and gas assets in 2021 was from the A-18 Block in the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area. Our equity emissions from this asset were approximately 1.2 million tonnes, an increase of 0.1 million tonnes from 2020. Major sources of emissions from our operated assets in 2021 included those from Hess MidstreamÕs Tioga Gas Plant (TGP) and our North Dakota, North Malay Basin and offshore Gulf of Mexico production assets, which together accounted for an estimated 1.8 million tonnes of equity emissions. Our other operated and nonoperated assets made up the balance of equity emissions at an estimated 0.9 million tonnes, of which Guyana accounted for approximately 0.4 million tonnes and our other assets accounted for a combined 0.5 million tonnes. Scope 3 Equity Emissions Scope 3 GHG emissions are those generated from corporate value chain activities that are not accounted for and reported in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We disclose our estimated Scope 3 GHG emissions, the vast majority of which are assumed Ð based on the methodology described below Ð to come from the processing and end use of our sold products, on an equity basis. To estimate our Scope 3 emissions, we follow the methodology established by IPIECA in its 2016 report Estimating Petroleum Industry Value Chain (Scope 3) Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This guidance, which is currently the industry standard, is based on the WRIÕs and World Business Council for Sustainable DevelopmentÕs As an additional measure beyond our emissions reduction efforts, which are currently focused on our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we are pursuing ways to help mitigate climate change on a global scale. Hess has made a multiyear financial commitment to help fund the Salk InstituteÕs Harnessing Plants InitiativeÕs research, which is comprised of two programs: CO2 Removal on a Planetary Scale (CRoPS) and Coastal Plant Restoration (CPR). The CRoPS program aims to increase suberin content Ð a carbon rich polymer found in plant roots Ð in common crops such as wheat, rice and corn with the goal to absorb and store significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. In addition to removing CO2, the enhanced root systems would help protect plants from droughts and other climate related threats, enrich soil with added carbon and potentially produce better yields. CRoPS may also allow farmers to sell carbon credits and provide an added income source in an emerging marketplace. The CPR project is focused on restoration and preservation of wetlands, which are significant carbon sinks. The project aims to develop wetland plants that can hold carbon, purify water, preserve land and thrive in challenging environments around the world. Salk aims to collaborate with governments and the agriculture industry to bring development of these specialized plants to a global scale by 2030, with the capability of absorbing and storing significant amounts of carbon per year from the atmosphere by 2035. Scope 3 guidance. Per the IPIECA guidance, we report Scope 3 emissions for category 11 ÒUse of Sold ProductsÓ by calculating combustion emissions for our oil, natural gas and marketed oil products. We also report Scope 3 category 10 ÒProcessing of Sold ProductsÓ emissions, which result from the refining of our crude oil production by others. In 2021, we enhanced the accuracy of our Scope 3 emissions calculations. For category 11, we previously assumed all liquids sold were crude oil. We now account for our two separate liquid products Ð crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) Ð by using separate emissions factors for each product. For category 10, where we previously applied a single GHG factor over time, we now use annual factors that take into account the improved efficiency and related emissions reductions at U.S. refineries between 2017 and 2021. This improved methodology has resulted in HessÕ Scope 3 emissions totals being lowered by approximately 4 million tonnes of CO2e each year between 2017 and 2020. In 2021, we sold 591 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of natural gas, which, when used by consumers, accounted for an estimated 11.7 million tonnes of GHG emissions. We sold 163 thousand barrels per day of crude oil and 53 thousand barrels per day of NGLs, which accounted for another estimated 25.8 million and 4.4 million tonnes, respectively, of GHG emissions, for an estimated total of 42 million tonnes of Scope 3 category 11 emissions. This crude oil, when processed by refiners, resulted in an additional estimated 1.4 million tonnes of Scope 3 category 10 emissions, which brings our total Scope 3 emissions to an estimated 43.4 million tonnes. Although not material, we also track, report and offset 100% of the Scope 3 emissions associated with employee business travel. We offset the approximate 400 tonnes of CO2e emissions associated with our employeesÕ business travel in 2021 with carbon credits related to a third party landfill gas to energy project in Whitfield County, Georgia, U.S. EMISSIONS REDUCTION INITIATIVES In support of our GHG emissions and flaring intensity reduction targets, we track and monitor air emissions at each of our assets and undertake a variety of emissions reduction initiatives.

A subgroup of this task force is working to identify and recommend GHG reduction opportunities, evaluating and implementing technologies as appropriate and evaluating capital and infrastructure infrastructure; enhanced communication requirements. Currently, the group is with third party gatherers; and improved evaluating, piloting or implementing planning of new wells to prioritize 80 250 the following emissions reduction gathering of new natural gas production. 70.9215 opportunities: We are taking multiple steps, which are 70 19461.3 200 described on the following pages, to 60¥ Optimizing Hess MidstreamÕs gas 55.2 Flaring Intensity (SCF per BOE)eliminate routine flaring by the end ofgathering infrastructure in the Bakken, 52.0 Flaring (MMSCFD)50 2025.which includes additional compression 40 32.7capacity and gathering lines More than $3.6 billion has been spent on 30 ¥ Installing oil coolers to stabilize oil and midstream infrastructure in North Dakota 20 50reduce tank gas flashing to flare over the past 10 years, supporting our strong performance over the past several 10 ¥ Reinjecting NGLs into the product line 0years.

The maintenance activities completed during the turnaround will help to maintain a safe and reliable plant. The turnaround, along with an expansion project that was completed in 2020, increased processing capacity from 250 to 400 MMSCFD. During the turnaround, as expected, we lost the capacity to gather and process natural gas at the TGP. However, with careful planning prior to the turnaround Ð entering into natural gas offload agreements and executing pipeline interconnects that allowed Hess to sell natural gas that would otherwise have been flared Ð we successfully reduced gas flaring during the turnaround by 70% compared with the amount anticipated. Ultimately, the increased capacity gained from the expansion project is expected to help us reduce flaring in future years. These improvements in capacity at the TGP are complemented by the Little Missouri 4 gas plant, operated by Targa Resources, which came online in 2019 and can process 200 MMSCFD of natural gas. Hess Midstream owns 50% interest in the Little Missouri 4 gas plant. Note: Hess 2021 portfolio includes Denmark. Divested assets includes assets divested prior to 2021. We also installed an additional 14 MMSCFD of capacity at the new Blue Buttes Compressor Station in the second quarter of 2021, which has further expanded our ability to bring more natural gas to market. We plan to continue to add a further 85 MMSCFD of natural gas compression and gathering capacity in 2022, with the capability to expand up to 130 MMSCFD in the future. These improvements will help us continue to reduce flaring. In addition to infrastructure buildout, we have continued to improve compressor station reliability in 2021. We have reduced compressor trips and routine downtime issues and as a result we have reduced our flaring by 1.8 MMSCFD, which equates to approximately 56,000 tonnes of CO e per year.2 In some cases, Hess relies on third parties to provide the natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure needed to mitigate gas flaring. In 2021, we were able to reduce our reliance on these third parties due to the additional infrastructure Hess Midstream brought online during the year. We have also enhanced our relationships and lines of communication with third parties to further reduce downtime and bottlenecks. We estimate that these enhancements helped to generate a 2 MMSCFD reduction in flaring, equivalent to a reduction of approximately 63,000 tonnes of CO2e during the year. We are continuing to explore additional commercial arrangements to improve third party gas gathering and processing capacity and performance, supporting reduced flaring. Methane Reducing methane emissions, which represent around 8% of our operated Scope 1 GHG emissions, continues to be an important priority for Hess. Our major sources of methane, based on our regulatory emissions inventory estimates, are fugitive emissions from pneumatic devices, pumps, tanks, compressor seals and pipelines, and the residual unburned methane associated with flaring. In 2021, our total Scope 1 methane emissions were around 8,395 tonnes, which equates to approximately 210,000 tonnes of CO2e (assuming a Global Warming Potential of 25). This represents a 22% reduction from 2020 and a 33% reduction from 2017. In support of our medium term climate related strategy, we established a 2025 global methane intensity target of 0.19% versus a 2017 baseline of 0.40%, using natural gas sales as a denominator. Our 2021 intensity based on this methodology was 0.18%, surpassing our 2025 target (see pages 8 and 50). ONE Future We continue to pursue voluntary reductions in methane emissions in two areas: performance based targets and best practices. In support of this strategy, in 2014, Hess and seven other companies founded the ONE Future Coalition Ð a group with representation from across the natural gas value chain focused on identifying policy and technical solutions that yield continuous improvement in the management of methane emissions associated with the production, gathering and boosting, processing, transportation and distribution of natural gas. By the U.S.Onshore U.S. Onshore Processing Upstream ONE Future 2025 Target (i.e., production, gathering and boosting, and processing). Our relative methane intensity continues to improve, and we attribute this to flaring reduction, the continued implementation of our LDAR program across all of our North Dakota production facilities and our program to phase out high bleed pneumatic controllers. The Environmental Partnership In a related voluntary effort to adopt and promote industry best practices, Hess became one of the founding participants of The Partnership in 2017. The Partnership is focused on technologically feasible and commercially proven solutions that result in significant emissions reductions. In addition to specifying best practices for member companies over specific time frames, The Partnership provides a forum for participants to share information and analyze best practices and technological breakthroughs in order to help the industry improve its understanding of emissions reduction strategies. A key goal of The Partnership is furthering action to reduce air emissions associated with natural gas and oil production. The Partnership has initiated six Environmental (Tonnes Methane Emitted/Tonnes Methane Produced) 0.80% 0.70% 0.60% 0.50% 0.40% 0.30% 0.20% 0.10% 0.00% U.S.Onshore U.S. Onshore Production Gas Gathering and Boosting . 2017 . 2018 . 2019 . 2020 . 2021 end of 2021, ONE Future membership had grown to over 50 companies. ONE Future offers a performance based, flexible approach that is expected to yield significant reductions in methane emissions. ONE FutureÕs measurement protocol has been approved by the EPA. The goal of ONE Future is to voluntarily lower methane emissions to less than 1% of gross methane production across the U.S. value chain by 2025. Peer reviewed analyses indicate that a leak/loss rate of 1% or less across the U.S. natural gas value chain provides immediate GHG reduction benefits. To achieve this goal, ONE Future has established 2025 methane emissions rate targets for each sector of the natural gas value chain: production (0.28%), gathering and boosting (0.08%), processing (0.11%), transmission and storage (0.30%) and distribution (0.22%), which cumulatively total the 1% target. In 2020, the ONE Future membersÕ cumulative methane emissions intensity was 0.42% across the U.S. natural gas value chain. ONE FutureÕs 2021 progress report will be published later this year. In 2021, HessÕ onshore U.S. methane intensity was 0.29%, which is below the 2025 ONE Future combined target of 0.47% for the sectors in which we operate Performance Programs and allows member companies to decide which are best suited for their operations. Hess was one of the first companies to commit to participating, and we have been implementing five of the six programs in North Dakota, as follows: ¥ Leak Program for Natural Gas and Oil Production Sources: Participants will implement monitoring and timely repair of fugitive emissions at selected sites utilizing detection methods and technologies such as EPA Method 21 or optical gas imaging cameras. Hess conducted 790 semiannual surveys at 355 sites in 2021, less than in 2020 due to the sale of legacy sites. Of the 2.25 million devices and components surveyed, only 0.07% were found to be leaking. The majority (70%) of those components with leaks were repaired immediately and the remaining 30% were repaired within 30 days following the survey. Since our first year of participation in this program in 2019, our leak occurrence rate has reduced by 42%, from 0.11% to 0.07%. ¥ Replace, Remove or Retrofit High Bleed Pneumatic Controllers: Participants will remove, replace or retrofit high bleed controllers with low or zero emitting devices within five years. Hess completed our phaseout of high bleed pneumatic controllers in our North Dakota operations in 2021. We replaced 60 high bleed controllers with low bleed controllers and removed seven from service. In 2021, this phaseout program reduced our overall pneumatic controller methane emissions by 80%, from 1,583 tonnes of methane in 2019 to 318 tonnes. ¥ Compressor Program: Participants are committed to implementing practices that minimize emissions associated with centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. These include conversion of compressors to electric drive, improving vent gas capture and improving rod packing replacement practices. ¥ Pipeline Blowdowns: Participants are committed to implementing reduction practices that minimize emissions during pipeline blowdowns. We are implementing best practices to reduce methane emissions, including routing blowdown gas to low pressure systems or to flare. ¥ Flare Management Program: Participants are committed to implementing approved flare volume and emissions reduction practices and reporting the companyÕs flare volumes to demonstrate progress. The sixth program, focused on manual liquids unloading for natural gas production sources, is not applicable to Hess because we do not currently operate any natural gas-only production wells. Hess submits information on our implementation of the programs applicable to our operations to The Partnership, which in turn publishes an annual report. We also plan to report on our progress in implementing these applicable programs as part of our annual sustainability report. The Partnership continues to assist members with identifying additional techniques with greater sophistication The following case studies are additional examples of emissions reduction initiatives at Hess. Natural Gas Capture We have continued to use technology developed through our partnership with GTUIT Ð a designer, manufacturer and operator of wellsite natural gas capture and natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction equipment Ð to recover high British thermal unit gas from locations in North Dakota that were previously flaring this raw, wet natural gas. The GTUIT equipment successfully addresses some of the technical challenges associated with capturing NGLs from the Bakken gas. The units are modular and mobile, can operate reliably unmanned and can adapt to the changing flow conditions at the well level. In 2021, we operated four GTUIT mobile units with four million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of capacity in total, allowing us to capture 3.6 million gallons of NGLs. These four units were utilized on a continuous basis. As a result of this NGL capture, about 139 MMSCFD of gas flaring was avoided, and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions were reduced by an estimated 22,427 tonnes. This project provides dual economic and environmental benefits because it converts gas into marketable products as well as reduces the amount of gas flared and the associated air emissions. Flexible Hose for Freshwater Transport In North Dakota, we continue to utilize flexible hose to transport fresh water directly from water sources to our wells, instead of using truck transport. In 2021, 100% of the water we used for hydraulic fracturing in North Dakota (approximately 15.1 million barrels) was transported using flexible hoses, eliminating 134,420 truck deliveries and 6.72 million truck miles driven and reducing nearly 14,640 tonnes of transportation related greenhouse gas emissions. Utilizing Wellsite Natural Gas for Electricity In 2021, we continued our collaboration with Digital Stream Energy (DSE) to take natural gas from a wellsite that would otherwise be flared to generate electricity. The electricity generated is used to power computer servers. The natural gas consumed by DSE in 2021 was 87.6 MMSCF, which equates to around 4,770 tonnes of CO2e emissions. The key benefit is that gas that would otherwise be flared is put to use. We continue to work with DSE in 2022 and are evaluating the application of this technology at additional sites. Replacement of Diesel with Natural Gas Hess MidstreamÕs compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel facility near the Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota has been in operation since 2016. The CNG is partially displacing diesel in high horsepower engines for drilling and in water heaters for well completion operations in the region and is capable of fueling CNG/gasoline bifuel light duty trucks. In 2021, the operation of this facility helped to displace 1.2 million gallons of diesel fuel, resulting in a reduction of approximately 3,500 tonnes of CO2e. to detect, repair and prevent leaks from oil and gas operations. Those efforts include facilitating collaboration with other operators and technology providers. For example, The Partnership is collaborating with several groups to understand their capabilities in aerial technologies and plans to introduce the technology to participating companies. Hess has actively participated in these efforts and, going forward, will promote the expanded use of aerial surveys to advance our understanding of emissions and contribute to the common industry goal of minimizing methane emissions. Further detail on our LDAR program is provided in the Environment section of this report and at hess.com/sustainability/ environment ENERGY USE Reducing our energy use has the dual benefit of lowering costs and GHG emissions, and it is a central focus of both our environment, health, safety and social responsibility strategy and our Lean approach to managing our business. We generate and purchase energy primarily for power, processing, heating and cooling. In 2021, energy consumption from Hess operated assets was approximately 26.5 million gigajoules, 1% higher than in 2020. Seventy percent of HessÕ energy use was directly generated from our operations, primarily at Hess MidstreamÕs TGP and at our production facilities in North Dakota, the North Malay Basin, Denmark and the Gulf of Mexico. The remaining 30% was indirect energy (i.e., energy used by utilities to provide electricity) purchased for our North Dakota production operations and Hess MidstreamÕs TGP. In 2021, our U.S. operations accounted for more than 99% of our purchased electricity of approximately 870,000 megawatt hours (MWh), a 4% increase from last year, primarily attributable to increased production in North Dakota and the conversion of new compressor stations from natural gas to electric compression. We support renewable energy through the purchase of RECs that offset 100% of the net electricity used in our operations. Thousand Gigajoules 30,000 27,177 25,000  26,288  26,541  20,000  15,000  10,000  5,000  0 2019 ÷ Direct ÷ Indirect  2020  2021  To offset our approximately 870,000 MWh of purchased electricity, we purchased 869,928 RECs, primarily from wind power generation. See more detail on our purchased electricity use in our expanded performance data at hess.com/sustainability/performance-data/ key-sustainability-metrics Environment Safeguarding the environment is a core commitment for Hess and is incorporated into the Hess Values. We seek to continuously improve our performance across the range of potential environmental impacts, including water and energy use, air emissions, waste and spills, and doing so is embedded in the Hess Operational Management System (HOMS) that guides the work we do every day. We dedicate significant staff and resources to this effort to help ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, international standards and voluntary commitments. We have developed specific goals and key performance metrics to drive and track improvements in our environmental performance at both the enterprise and asset levels. Some of these metrics are factored into our annual incentive plan, helping to further advance our culture of environmental stewardship. We collaborate with peers, governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to help drive environmental performance improvements across our industry. As an example, we sponsor and actively participate in the Bakken Production Optimization Program, a research program led by the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) and funded by the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) that aims to improve Bakken system oil recovery and reduce the environmental footprint of Bakken oil and gas operations. We work with the EERC as part of the Intelligent Pipeline Integrity Program, a consortium of oil and gas producers leading and funding research on innovative technologies to detect leaks and other pipeline integrity issues (see page 65). We also voluntarily sponsor the Houston Advanced Research Center, which aims to develop science based solutions to environmental issues associated with oil and gas development. WATER MANAGEMENT At Hess, we know that the communities and ecosystems where we operate depend on water to thrive and our operations have the potential to impact this resource, primarily through our use of fresh water and possible impacts on water quality that could occur due to well integrity issues, spills or discharges. Responsible water management is a focus of our environmental efforts and continues to be one of our key sustainability issues. We continue to employ a risk based, lifecycle approach to managing water through which we carefully assess and work to mitigate any potential impacts on water resources in both our onshore and offshore operations. In 2021, we updated our water stressed resource analysis in the Bakken region Ð our only onshore operations and the primary region where we use fresh water for our operations Ð using the World Resources InstituteÕs Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. While this analysis confirmed that we are not operating in any areas of high baseline water stress and the potential for us to impact fresh water is therefore limited, this remains an important issue to us and our stakeholders. In 2021, we completed a water data mapping exercise for our North Malay Basin asset and a chemical analysis for Denmark. Through this effort, we validated water usage and discharge data and incorporated the associated processes into our HOMS Tier II Assurance efforts. Based on assurance reviews of our water data collection and tracking processes, we developed corrective actions to help us track these data at a more granular level and enhance our management of water resources. Engaging with stakeholders is central to our approach to water management. In North Dakota, our water use strategy is based on engagement and feedback with local stakeholders such as the NDIC, the Army Corps of Engineers, the North Dakota State Engineer and the Western Area Water Supply Authority. We are active members of the IPIECA Water Working Group, which aims to help companies improve their water use performance by providing sound analysis, assessment tools, good practices, credible data sources and appropriate indicators. We are members of the Energy Water Initiative, a collaborative effort among 20 oil and gas companies to study, describe and improve lifecycle water use and management in upstream unconventional oil and natural gas exploration and production. We also participate in the National Alliance for Water Innovation Ð a government, academic and private sector research partnership working to support a resilient water supply through applied research on affordable and energy efficient desalination and other advanced water treatment technologies. We engage with a variety of nonprofit organizations focused on water issues. In 2021, Hess continued supporting the Gulf of Mexico AllianceÕs Gulf Star program, a nonprofit, publicÐprivate partnership that aims to enhance the ecological and economic health of the Gulf region by encouraging collaboration among government agencies, businesses, education providers and NGOs. We also worked with the Galveston Bay Foundation and Pontchartrain Conservancy on water sampling projects and the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program on cultivating native plants and grasses to restore the function and habitat of critical Gulf Coast wetlands. See the Shale Energy section online for more detail on our approach to water management in our shale operations: hess.com/ sustainability/environment/shale-energy Freshwater Use We primarily use fresh water in our onshore upstream operations for drilling and completions, and for cooling in midstream gas processing. We also use fresh water in our offshore operations for some drilling activities and to supply potable water to personnel; however, we primarily meet these needs by converting seawater to fresh water through reverse osmosis.

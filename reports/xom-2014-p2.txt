Today. has led us on a decade-long journey toward superior envi ronmental performance. Our employees demonstrate their dedication to this goal every day by helping the organization achieve environmental leadership, caring about the communities where we work, and sharing our lessons learned with industry and our stakehold ers for the benefit of all. Protect Tomorrow. Today. is a challenge as we look at the global range of our operations. Being able to assess how the environment will change naturally and in response to a range of potential developments from us and the rest of the community requires insight, a broad range of data and analytical skills. Through my travels and interactions with many affili ates globally, I see we have great people working the issues, and I have the confidence in them to assess these changes, and identify environmental manage ment strategies and studies to reduce or eliminate our impacts.” — Russell Tait Chief environmental scientist Environmental management Ten years ago, this report introduced Protect Tomorrow. Today., a set of expectations that serves as the foundation for our environmental performance. Guided by a scientific under.standing of the environmental impacts and related risks of our operations, as well as the social and economic needs of the communities in which we do business, these principles have become an integral part of our day-to-day work. The three key principles of Protect Tomorrow. Today. are: • Delivery of superior environmental performance, leading to a competitive advantage; • Driving environmental incidents with real impact to zero, through a process of continuous improvement; and • Achieving industry leadership in focus areas valuable to the business. These principles, along with the existing corporate environ.mental policy, helped define a set of environmental perfor.mance expectations. We outline our approach to achieving these expectations throughout this chapter. Environmental management is important for our business, as well as the world in which we live and operate. Globally, our projects are carried out in a diverse range of settings that have varying environmental, social and health risks. We systematically identify, assess, manage and monitor these risks throughout the life cycle of our work. Our pursuit of superior environmental performance is founded on a thorough under.standing of local regulatory, environmental, socioeconomic and health contexts. Early on and throughout an asset’s life cycle, we identify potential risks through our Environmental Aspects Assessment (EAA) and Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA) processes. We also prepare Environmental, Socioeconomic and Health Manage.ment Plans and Environmental Business Plans (EBPs) to guide the implementation of mitigation and monitoring strategies aimed at effectively managing impacts and their associated risks. We integrate stakeholder engagement into this effort throughout the asset life cycle. Environmental risk management, along with risk management in all facets of our business, is guided by our Operations Integ.rity Management System (OIMS). This disciplined approach establishes a common framework for addressing safety, security, health, environmental and social risks and their related impacts. It also provides a systematic, structured approach to measure progress and track accountability across business lines, facilities and projects. Visit our website for more detailed information about OIMS and our overall environmental, regu.latory and socioeconomic management approach. ExxonMobil’s OIMS brochure Biodiversity and ecosystem services Biodiversity and ecosystem services — the direct and indirect benefits people obtain from the environment, such as food, water, shelter, clean air and cultural identity — are important for society, and we work to protect them wherever we operate. Our approach recognizes factors such as the rarity of individual species, their roles in different ecosystems and habitats, their vulnerabilities and their cultural significance. As part of the expectations of Protect Tomorrow. Today., we strive to be a leader in safeguarding the ability of the environment to provide these ecosystem services. For our major Upstream projects, we identify and evaluate environmental, social and health risks and opportunities through the ESHIA process. Additionally, biodi.versity and ecosystem services are taken into account during the EAA and EBP processes throughout the life of an asset. Environmental Aspects Guide Protecting biodiversity We continually look for new tools and analytical methods to improve our understanding of local biodiversity conditions and ecosystem services in our areas of operation. In 2014, we continued our study of the ecosystem services in the Gulf of Mexico in collaboration with the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies. As part of this effort, we engaged local businesses, federal agencies, researchers and NGOs in an Up Close: Ecosystem management on Alaska’s North Slope The Arctic region represents one of the world’s largest remain.ing areas of undiscovered oil and gas resources, and we expect the Arctic to play a critical role in helping to meet the world’s growing energy demand. We understand that operating in this region presents unique technological, environmental and social challenges. ExxonMobil’s Point Thomson Project is on the North Slope of Alaska, adjacent to the Beaufort Sea. Initial production is set to begin in 2016. From the outset of the project, ExxonMobil has worked to understand the local physical, biological and social environment. We engage with stakeholders in local communi.ties and with government and regulatory agencies to help us address biodiversity and sustainability challenges. ExxonMobil has participated in meetings and workshops with North Slope Borough officials and residents, and hosted regular community meetings in the village of Kaktovik to develop a deeper under.standing of local concerns and priorities. This dialogue resulted in project design modifications, cooperation to avoid conflicts with traditional subsistence hunting, cultural resource protec.tion, education and research programs, and wildlife monitoring surveys to understand present-day conditions and mitigate possible impacts on caribou and fish. Two of these monitoring surveys are summarized below. • ExxonMobil conducted aerial surveys in June 2013 and June 2014 to count caribou in the project area and document calving locations. We deployed motion-activated cameras between May and September in both years to document caribou movements near planned infrastructure (2013) and behavior around constructed facilities (2014). The project team worked with the state of Alaska to collar nine female caribou in the area to improve our understand.ing of the animals’ migration patterns. Analysis of the data indicated the installed pipeline had no observable effects on the movements of caribou within the study area. • In 2013 and 2014, ExxonMobil performed near-shore fish and sediment surveys in the summer months using fyke and gill nets to identify the types and numbers of marine fish near the project’s location. Some fish tissue and sediment testing was conducted to understand present-day levels of specific chemical compounds. We concluded that fish catch patterns and relative abundance were similar for each year, and the concentrations of the targeted chemical compounds in sediment and fish were consistently low and typical of the natural Beaufort Sea environment. attempt to prioritize ecosystem services provided by the Gulf. Results of this study are currently being prepared for submis.sion to a peer-reviewed journal. “Understanding the value that stakeholders place on the services provided by the offshore environment is important to the scientific community, ocean industries, government entities and NGOs. ExxonMobil is a key partner in advancing this knowledge.” Professor David Yoskowitz Endowed chair for socioeconomics at the Harte Research Institute and renowned ecosystem services expert Several of our biodiversity experts also published a peer-reviewed article in 2014 that outlined an ecosystem services approach to marine environmental management. Using the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as a case study, our researchers developed a methodology, adaptable for use in a variety of environmental settings, that can be used for prioritizing moni.toring efforts to protect the health of ecosystem services. Rapid prioritization of marine ecosystem services and ecosystem indicators ExxonMobil is also proud to support innovative research for improved biodiversity management. In 2014, we contrib.uted approximately $5 million to organizations focused on biodiversity protection and land conservation. For example, ExxonMobil Research Qatar is collaborating with Qatar University and Texas A&M University at Galveston to study the dugong population — a marine mammal species that the Inter.national Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed as vulnerable to extinction — in Qatar’s coastal waters. “It is essential to both Qatar and ExxonMobil to increase our understanding of the marine environment, and we hope the data gathered in this study can be utilized by other academic, regulatory and research stakeholders in support of management and conservation plans for the dugong population.” — Dr. Jennifer Dupont, research director, ExxonMobil Research Qatar Working in protected areas To ensure adequate plans are in place at our sites to manage elevated biodiversity or species risks, we periodically screen the locations of our major operating facilities against data.bases of the IUCN and World Protected Areas. We confirmed an estimated 20 percent of our major operating facilities are within five kilometers of designated environmentally protected areas. These data are also used when developing emergency response contingency plans that prioritize areas needing pro.tection, as well as in environmental impact surveys during new or brownfield development. We continue to collaborate with the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) to develop educational and outreach programs through the Corporate Lands for Learning (CLL) program. Currently, we have five CLL programs certified at or near our facilities, including at our Billings (Montana) Refinery, Baton Rouge (Louisiana) Complex, Clinton (New Jersey) Research Facility, Fife (United Kingdom) Ethylene Plant and Lentol Gar.dens in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York. These programs help us promote environmental awareness, biodiversity and science initiatives in our workforce and local communities. By the end of 2014, we actively managed 7,200 acres of land for the benefit of wildlife at 18 of our sites through 21 certified programs. Our newest WHC Wildlife at Work site is at our North Houston Campus, which features 195 acres of wildlife habitat. Surveys at the campus identified 343 ecologically valuable trees, of which 213 were preserved in place. Profes.sional arborists moved the remaining trees to other locations within the campus and are providing observation and care to ensure their continued health. Ongoing monitoring programs on the campus focus on the presence of bird species and the detection and removal of invasive plant species. Up Close: Monitoring the Steller’s sea eagle In the vicinity of Exxon Neftegas Limited’s operations on Sakhalin Island in Russia, we have studied and monitored the Steller’s sea eagle, an IUCN Red List species, for many years. Since 2006, we have focused on 13 pairs of the eagles near our Chayvo project location. We have built 35 perches and 15 nesting platforms to improve the habitat and promote nesting and hatching success. The eagles have shown their ability to adapt to our presence as they continue to hunt and nest in the area. Since the monitoring program began, we have observed the average nesting capacity of fledglings per occupied nest near Chayvo is higher than the average for the island as a whole. We will continue to monitor this important species in the coming years. Up Close: Protecting whales in the Gulf of Mexico and Australia ExxonMobil helped fund a sperm whale tagging and monitor.ing study in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2014. Professor Bruce Mate of Oregon State University — one of the world’s foremost experts on whale tagging and tracking — led the study, which enabled mapping of key sperm whale habitat areas. We are using the results in our environmental stewardship programs to continue to safeguard calving areas and other key whale habitats. In collaboration with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Man.agement and other industry partners, ExxonMobil is also a key sponsor of a research effort to study the behavioral response of Australian humpback whales to seismic surveys. The main objectives of the study are to improve risk assessments for seismic surveys and apply new science to the process of impact assessment and management. We completed the final field season in 2014, and a team of internationally recognized experts from several Australian universities is now analyzing the significant amount of data. Results to date are available at soundandmarinelife.org. Australian humpback whale. How much water is needed to produce one quart of oil-equivalent energy?1 Water management Freshwater intensity is the total amount of freshwater needed to produce an identical unit of energy for a variety of energy sources and transportation fuels. 1Adapted from the freshwater intensity page at exxonmobil.com. Water and energy are interrelated, and both are critical for society, economic development and the environment. ExxonMobil manages water resources with care, using the same systems, processes and policies that govern our overall approach to environmental management. In 2014, we pub.lished four key commitments in a framework for water man.agement that focus on preventing adverse impacts to water resources while carefully managing the water we do use. For more information about how ExxonMobil manages water, visit our website. ExxonMobil’s approach to water use We are committed to minimizing the impacts of our water withdrawals, consumption and discharges. In 2014, the net freshwater consumption at our operations was 270 million cubic meters, representing a continued decline since 2011. Global freshwater consumption2 Millions of cubic meters 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 280 2014 270 2This year, for the first time, we are reporting freshwater intensity alongside consumption data in our performance data (pages 71–73). Freshwater intensity is the ratio of net freshwater consumption to the amount of throughput or production. Normalized in this way, we can better understand how efficiently we are using freshwater in our operations. Data collection began in 2007.   Includes XTO Energy data beginning in 2011. We have reduced our freshwater consumption by 15 percent since 2007, in part due to local water management strat.egies. ExxonMobil’s total water consumption includes use by Downstream refineries and Chemical plants, Upstream oil and gas production, and XTO Energy for onshore shale development in the United States. The vast majority of our water consumption occurs in Downstream refineries and Chemical plants, with XTO Energy accounting for only approximately 4 percent of the total. We recognize some of our operations can use significant amounts of water, and we engage with stakeholders regard.ing their concerns about the use and protection of local water resources. We consider local water requirements and alternatives when sourcing water for our activities, including identifying and managing the risks related to water availability and quality. Of our major operating sites, approximately 30 percent are located in areas identified with the potential for water stress or scarcity. We develop and implement local water management strategies, including the use of freshwater alter.natives such as recycled municipal and industrial wastewater, seasonal water management and rainwater harvesting. Local water management efforts at key sites have contrib.uted to the gradual decline in our water consumption since 2011. For example, the wastewater treatment facility at our Singapore chemical plant uses state-of-the-art membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology to treat wastewater, enabling it to be reused as cooling water. This reduces the overall amount of freshwater used in the plant by 3 percent, and the remaining treated wastewater to be discharged is well within the specifications set by the Singapore government. Since reuse of the MBR-treated water started in May 2014, on average, 30 to 40 percent of treated water is reused as cooling water, and further increases are planned. We use alternative water sources where appropriate and seek opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle water. We assess actual costs, quality and availability, as well as potential trade-offs, such as varied operational efficiencies, increased energy use or the consequences of producing more concentrated waste streams. Up Close: Management of seismicity in unconventional operations Some stakeholders have expressed concern about the risk of induced seismicity near unconventional operations. ExxonMobil takes a diligent risk management approach toward limiting induced seismicity in our operations. We are exploring research opportunities focused on improved understanding of the phenomenon of induced seismicity to share with com.munities, academia and regulators, and further strengthen our risk management systems. The science of earthquakes can be complex. Earthquakes are caused mostly by natural processes. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates there are more than 1 million natural earthquakes each year, whereas according to a 2012 National Academy of Sciences report, there have been only 155 cases of induced or man-made seismicity documented globally over the past 80 years. Seismicity due to wastewater injection wells is uncommon, and events due to hydraulic fracturing are even rarer. We have a cross-functional team of experts in our company studying induced seismicity and examining our operations and the related science. This team developed a protocol that we now use at XTO Energy to assess the existing underground geology in more detail, focusing on the risks of potentially inducing seismicity when we are siting new wastewater disposal wells. Further, we are highly engaged in academic and regulatory discussions; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory bodies have asked us to present our perspectives and peer-review their reports. Another example, from the Upstream operations, shows our continual efforts to use research and operational analysis to improve capabilities and performance. Imperial, an ExxonMobil affiliate in Canada, committed to freshwater reduction projects at its Cold Lake operations as part of a water license renewal in 2011. By 2014, the projects were completed and successfully reduced freshwater consumption by 30 percent compared with the 2006–2008 average. Imperial is also a member of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), an industry group focused on improvements in environmental perfor.mance in Canada’s oil sands through collaborative action and innovation. One key focus area for COSIA is to reduce freshwater intensity for in situ oil sands operations, which will require COSIA members to improve water use efficiency and recycle rates within their operations. Spill performance ExxonMobil focuses on implementing preventive measures to avoid spills and, if a spill does occur, ensure a rapid, com.prehensive response. We continually seek to develop and improve risk management, operations integrity, spill prevention processes and containment capabilities. The total volume of hydrocarbons spilled to soil and water was 9,100 barrels in 2014; more than 60 percent was recovered at the spill sites. The majority of these spills do not affect third parties or the communities that surround us. Over the past decade, we have reduced the number of spills greater than 1 barrel by approximately 10 percent. In 2012, we started measuring significant spills to the environ.ment (SSEs) across the corporation. SSEs are spills to surface water and groundwater, sensitive environments or communi.ties. We had 20 significant spills in 2014, including a spill from a time-chartered marine vessel involving a small amount of gasoil to water during a cargo transfer. These SSEs represent approximately 6 percent of the total number of spills. We are increasing focus on these spills to learn from them so we can prevent their reoccurrence. Significant spills to the environment3 Number of spills of any fluid type that warrant greater focus 2012 20 2013 15 2014 20 3We started measuring SSEs in 2012. Spills (not from marine vessels)4 Number of oil, chemical and drilling fluid spills greater than 1 barrel 2005 370 2006 295 2007 253 2008 211 2009 242 2010 210 2011 484 2012 356 2013 330 2014 335 Spills to water Spills to soil 4Includes XTO Energy data beginning in 2011. Every day, ExxonMobil Pipeline Company transports approx.imately 2.6 million barrels of petroleum and chemical feed-stocks and products through approximately 8,000 miles of pipelines in the United States. We diligently maintain and inspect our pipelines to ensure their integrity and prevent and detect corrosion, third-party damage or intrusions onto our rights of way. We also patrol our pipeline routes on the ground and in the air, and we monitor pipeline operations around the clock using state-of-the-art systems, alarms and other monitoring technologies. For information on how we are managing products transported by rail, see page 15. We have implemented enhanced surveying techniques and are applying state-of-the-art inspection technologies and analyses on our pipelines. These surveys and inspection findings are identifying areas where we can strengthen our pipeline integrity and risk management systems. In addition, we are working closely with others in the industry to evaluate and capture technology advancements for pipeline integrity assurance. “Our company is built on the foundation of risk management for everything we do. During my career, I have had the oppor.tunity to work in Refining, Chemical and Lubricant manufac.turing roles around the world. I firmly believe if we manage risks right, we can prevent significant process safety events, including spills to the environment. Effectively managing risks is fundamental to successful business performance.” Lynne Lachenmyer Safety, security, health and environment vice president The worldwide marine business of ExxonMobil’s affiliates, which involves about 500 vessels in daily service, logged nearly 20,000 voyages and 42,000 port calls in 2014, safely transporting approximately 1.35 billion barrels of crude oil and refined products. In 2014, our marine affiliate, SeaRiver Maritime Inc., launched a new crude oil tanker, Liberty Bay, to transport crude oil from the Alaska North Slope to refiner.ies along the U.S. west coast. While all of the vessels owned and operated by SeaRiver have mandatory double-hull cargo tanks, Liberty Bay also features the latest safety, navigation and ExxonMobil employees conducting ice testing in the Kara Sea to measure the thickness and robustness of the ice.

An advanced ballast water treatment system will provide additional environmental protection, in advance of international requirements. Offshore oil spill response As part of our commitment to operational excellence, we have developed specialized spill response tactics. We have the industry’s leading, dedicated, in-house oil spill response research program, which includes a focus on Arctic research. ExxonMobil also participates in multiple joint industry projects for improving oil spill response in the Arctic and elsewhere, including the American Petroleum Institute (API) joint industry task force, the International Association of Oil and Gas Pro.ducers (IOGP) Arctic oil spill response technology joint industry program, an IOGP and IPIECA joint industry project, and the API oil sands technical subcommittee. These projects allow us to share best practices and learn from our peers. For more information, visit the following websites: API joint industry task force Arctic oil spill response technology IOGP-IPIECA joint industry project Since 2010, we have collaborated with others in our industry through our membership in the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) to develop an oil spill containment system for the Gulf of Mexico. In support of MWCC, ExxonMobil led a Marine Well Containment System project, which commenced delivery of an expanded containment system (ECS) in 2014. The ECS significantly increases the response capability of MWCC both in terms of capacity and flexibility. For more information about the ECS, visit MWCC’s website. Marine Well Containment Company In 2014, an ExxonMobil and Rosneft joint venture conducted drilling operations at the University-1 well in Russia’s Kara Sea. This was the capstone of extensive preparations that included environmental studies, seismic operations, employment of an advanced ice management system and integration of a winterized drilling rig. A fleet of multifunctional support vessels accompanied the rig to maintain operations integrity, conduct.ing safe operations hundreds of miles from the shore base. The preparations for and completion of operations at the University-1 well demonstrated our ability to integrate the people, technologies and best practices needed to operate in an Arctic offshore environment safely and effectively, and further added to our knowledge base for operations in the Arctic. Air emissions We continue to seek opportunities to reduce the environ.mental impacts from our operations and our products. Our combined emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) have decreased more than 40 percent over the past 10 years across all of our operations. Our Baytown (Texas) refining and petrochemical complex has also achieved near double-digit improvements in energy efficiency and air quality during the past decade. Despite its size and complexity, the Baytown Refinery now uses energy more efficiently than 90 percent of all other U.S. refineries. Over the past decade, energy efficiency across the Baytown complex has improved by 10 percent, and NOx and VOC emissions have been reduced by 46 percent and 40 per.cent, respectively. During this same period, air-related incident performance has improved by 64 percent. “As a community partner in Baytown for 95 years, we are proud of our accomplishments. We remain committed to maintaining operational excellence and pioneering new ways to reduce emissions and improve air quality. Our mission is clear: Protect Tomorrow. Today.” Matt Crocker Baytown Refinery manager In 2014, we completed our clean fuels project at our refinery in Saudi Arabia, a joint venture of ExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco. This project’s desulfurization facilities are designed to cut sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel by more than 98 percent. The ultra-low sulfur fuels produced as a result of this investment will allow for reduced emissions when used in modern engines. Air emissions Millions of metric tons 0.40 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 VOCs SO2 NOx Environmental compliance We comply with all applicable host-country environmental laws and regulations, and we apply responsible standards where they do not exist. Wherever reasonable, we strive to go beyond compliance and demonstrate leadership in environ.mental management. One example of where we have gone beyond compliance is the installation of a denitrification facility as part of our biological oxidation basin replacement project at our Baton Rouge (Louisiana) Refinery. This additional voluntary capital investment for denitrification reduces our nitrate emis.sions to the Gulf of Mexico by up to 500 tons annually. Our worldwide environmental expenditures in 2014 totaled approximately $6 billion. This included an estimated $2.5 billion in capital expenditures and approximately $3.5 billion in operat.ing expenses. In 2014, 74 penalties, fines and settlements were paid — the same as in 2013 — accounting for less than 1 percent of total environmental expenditures, or about $15 million. Rehabilitating the environment As part of our life cycle approach to protecting the envi.ronment, we continue to enhance the rehabilitation of our no-longer-needed properties so they can have a beneficial next use. By taking actions today, we can ensure the land we use is available for environmental benefits and development in the future. Since its creation in 2008, ExxonMobil Environ.mental Services (EMES) — our global functional organization that provides guidance and support on remediation and surplus-site stewardship — has managed more than $5.1 billion on remediation work and returned more than 1,400 properties to beneficial end use. In 2014 alone, we monitored 5,600 active sites in our EMES global portfolio. Up Close: Rehabilitation projects in the Arctic Working in Arctic environments provides unique challenges for every phase of our operations, including remediation. The extreme climate, coupled with limited transportation options and waste disposal infrastructure, require ExxonMobil Environ.mental Services to use innovative techniques when reclaiming the environment. In Alaska, our Point Thomson Project conducted multiple tundra sod experiments to expand our knowledge of tun.dra rehabilitation techniques. One experiment used freshly harvested tundra sod and organic soil from the Point Thomson gravel mine to rehabilitate a portion of an existing gravel pad and create a vegetated buffer for a nearby stream. Another experiment involved placing tundra sod on a gravel slope to test its ability to provide slope stabilization. In addition, tundra sod was stacked, overwintered and transplanted the following summer to determine whether harvested sod would survive for later use. Monitoring of these experimental sites suggests these trials have been successful. “Tundra is inherently complex, and rehabilitation can take decades in the harsh Arctic environment. This work rep.resents an innovative approach to using valuable natural materials and accelerating the rehabilitation process. We have shared these techniques with industry partners, agen.cies and other stakeholders.” Brien Reep Safety, security, health and environment manager, Point Thomson Project At Tununuk Point in Canada, Imperial Environmental Services is working with the federal government to remediate a site that was a federal radar station after World War II and an Imperial Oil exploration logistics base from 1971 through 1984. We are also using bioremediation techniques and installing engineered containment systems on two site landfills. As with all of our projects, we employ a disciplined and structured risk manage.ment approach to ensure we are protecting the environment while also working safely. ExxonMobil employees and contractors working on the tundra sod project at Point Thomson. An employee at our Joliet Refinery in Channahon, Managing climate Illinois.

It is a global challenge, requiring solutions that balance geopolitical and economic considerations of diverse nations and communities around the world, with an understanding of the complex field of climate science. ExxonMobil brings significant capabilities to this discussion and the intellectual curiosity to pursue an understanding of the science behind the changes to our climate. In my role, I get to see the nexus of these issues, analyze the impact on the organization and shape our efforts.” — Susan Blevins U.S. greenhouse gas and climate change issue manager Society continues to face the dual challenge of expanding energy supplies to support economic growth and improve living standards, while simultaneously addressing the societal and environmental risks posed by rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. Our climate change risk management strategy includes four components: engag.ing on climate change policy and planning; mitigating GHG emissions in our operations; developing future technology; and developing products that reduce GHG emissions for customers. Engaging on climate change policy and planning Managing the risks of climate change requires the participation of governments, private companies, consumers and other stakeholders. We engage stakeholders directly and through trade associations around the world to encourage sound pol.icy solutions for addressing these risks.  Attributes of sound climate policy ExxonMobil believes the long-term objective of a climate change policy should be to reduce the risk of serious impacts to humanity and ecosystems at minimum societal cost, while recognizing the importance of abundant, reliable and affordable energy to enable improved living standards worldwide. Both developed and developing countries need to work together in crafting policies aimed at mitigating global CO2 emissions, while recognizing the potential for differing priorities. If policymakers choose to take action to address the risks of climate change, we believe effective policies will be those that: • Promote global participation; • Let market prices drive the selection of solutions; • Ensure a uniform and predictable cost of GHG emissions across the economy; • Minimize complexity and administrative costs; • Maximize transparency; and • Provide flexibility for future adjustments to react to devel.opments in climate science and the economic impacts of climate policies. We believe a properly designed, revenue-neutral carbon tax is a more effective policy option for imposing a cost on carbon than cap-and-trade schemes, regulations, mandates or stan.dards. Properly designed, a revenue-neutral carbon tax: • Is a more efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions, and thus is more transparent and predictable; • More easily lends itself to global application; • Avoids the complexity of building additional carbon security markets; • Can be implemented through the existing tax infrastructure; and • Is better-suited for setting a uniform standard to hold all nations accountable. Engaging stakeholders ExxonMobil engages a variety of stakeholders — including policymakers, investors, consumers, academia, NGOs and the public — on climate change issues of direct relevance to the company. We align our internal positions and external com.munications via a corporate-wide global climate change and GHG issue management team with national and regional sub-teams. This team applies corporate level policy principles and positions to external issues that arise at local, state, national and regional levels to ensure consistency across the globe. ExxonMobil employees also hold key leadership positions, including board of director positions, with many trade associa.tions that engage on climate change issues, including the API, IOGP and IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues. Additionally, we contribute to a wide range of academic and policy organizations that research and promote dialogue on domestic and foreign policy issues. We annually review our support of tax-exempt organizations and make appropriate adjustments. We publish a list of the 501(c)(3) organizations we support on our website and update the list annually. ExxonMobil Worldwide Giving Report Our scientists have been involved in climate change research and related policy analysis for more than 30 years, yielding more than 50 papers in peer-reviewed publications. Experts from our organization have participated in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since its inception. Most recently, our scientists contributed to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report in lead author, review editor and reviewer roles. Our scientists also participate in the work of the National Academy of Sciences, including its work to review the third U.S. National Climate Assessment Report and provide advice to the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in our operations We have a robust set of processes designed to improve effi.ciency, reduce emissions and contribute to effective long-term solutions to manage climate change risks. These processes include, where appropriate, setting tailored objectives at the business, site and equipment levels, and then stewarding progress toward meeting those objectives. Based on decades of experience, ExxonMobil believes this rigorous bottom-up approach is a more effective way to drive efficiency improve.ment and GHG emissions reduction than simply setting high-level corporate targets. We also believe that continuing to use this approach will yield further improvements in all sectors of our business. Our chairman and members of the management committee have primary responsibility for — and are actively engaged in — managing climate change risks.

To drive improvement, our merit-driven employee development and compensation systems integrate performance in environmental areas, includ.ing emissions and energy efficiency. In the near term, we are working to increase energy efficiency while reducing flaring, venting and fugitive emissions in our operations. In the medium term, we are deploying proven technologies such as cogeneration and, where technically and economically feasible, carbon capture and sequestration. Longer term, we are conducting and supporting research to develop breakthrough, game-changing technologies. In 2014, ExxonMobil’s net equity GHG emissions were 122 million CO2-equivalent metric tons.

Relative to our 2013 performance, our 2014 emissions decreased by approximately 3 million CO2-equivalent metric tons. This decrease was primarily driven by efficiency improvements outpacing production intensity increases, as well as asset divestments. 2014 Carbon Disclosure Project response Energy efficiency In 2014, energy used in our operations totaled 1.6 billion giga.joules, which is similar to our 2013 energy usage. Despite an increase in energy intensity in some parts of our business, our focus on efficiency has allowed energy consumption to remain essentially flat over the past five years. Energy consumed in our operations generates more than 80 percent of our direct GHG emissions and is one of our largest operating costs. As such, we have focused on energy efficiency for several decades. Since 2000, we have used our Global Energy Man.agement System in the Downstream and Chemical businesses, and our Production Operations Energy Management System in our Upstream businesses to identify and act on energy-savings opportunities.  Between 2002 and 2012, we improved energy efficiency by more than 10 percent in our global refining and chemical man.ufacturing operations. This began as a U.S. refining industry 10-year objective in 2002 as part of an initiative with the API, which we expanded to include our global refining and chem.ical manufacturing operations. In the 2012 Solomon Survey,1 ExxonMobil had five of the 10 most energy-efficient refineries in the Americas, with our Joliet (Illinois) Refinery being the most energy-efficient in the United States. This is an example of how our bottom-up approach has yielded industry-leading energy efficiency and GHG emissions reduction results. 1This survey is conducted every two years; the 2014 survey results will be available in mid-2015. ExxonMobil has been one of the largest natural gas producers in the world since our merger with XTO Energy in 2010. Up Close: The role of natural gas One of the greatest opportunities for society to reduce GHG emissions is through the use of natural gas in power genera.tion. Natural gas is a flexible, abundant and low-emissions fuel that is available across the globe. On a life-cycle basis, from extraction through electricity consumption, using natural gas emits 50 percent fewer GHG emissions than coal. It is also the ideal partner for intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, as it can provide power when these renew.able sources are not available. As the world moves toward a lower carbon-intensive energy mix over the coming decades, natural gas will be one of the most important fuels to enable reductions in GHG emissions. Since our merger with XTO Energy in 2010, ExxonMobil has been one of the largest natural gas producers in the world. Coupled with our leadership in the development and production of liquefied natural gas (LNG), ExxonMobil is well-positioned to meet growing demand for this clean energy source. Hydrocarbon flaring Millions of metric tons 2005 7.7 2006 8.2 2007 8.0 2008 5.7 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014   4.4 3.6 4.1 3.6 3.7 4.5  Upstream  Downstream  Chemical  Flaring In 2014, flaring volume from our combined Upstream, Down.stream and Chemical operations totaled 4.5 million metric tons. This represents an increase of 0.8 million metric tons compared with our 2013 performance. The increase in flaring in 2014 was primarily due to typical startup activities at our new LNG facility in Papua New Guinea, and assuming operatorship of the existing Usan production field in Nigeria, where we previously did not report flaring emissions since we did not operate the field. As we begin to apply our operating practices and procedures in the Usan field, we anticipate flaring to decrease. Consistent with the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Initiative, of which ExxonMobil is a charter member, and as specified in our Upstream Flaring and Venting Reduction Environmental Standard for Projects, our aim is to avoid routine flaring and venting of natural gas in new projects and reduce flaring in our existing operations.  Up Close: Managing the business risks of climate change ExxonMobil believes producing our existing hydrocarbon reserves is essential to meeting growing global energy demand. We enable consumers — especially those in the least-developed and most-vulnerable economies — to pursue higher living standards and greater economic opportunity. We believe all economic energy sources will be necessary to meet growing demand, and the transition of the energy system to lower carbon sources will take many decades due to its enormous scale, capital intensity and complexity. As such, we believe that none of our proven hydrocarbon reserves are, or will become, stranded. Energy and Carbon — Managing the Risks ExxonMobil makes long-term investment decisions based in part on our comprehensive annual analysis that underpins our global Outlook for Energy. We project an energy-related CO2 emissions profile through 2040. This can be compared with the energy-related CO2 emissions profiles from various scenarios outlined by the IPCC. When we do this, our Outlook emissions profile would closely approximate the IPCC’s inter.mediate Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 emissions profile in shape, but is slightly under it in magnitude. We address the potential for future climate change policy, including the potential for restrictions on emissions, by esti.mating a proxy cost of carbon. This cost, which in some geog.raphies may approach $80 per ton by 2040, has been included in our Outlook for several years. This approach seeks to reflect potential policies governments may employ related to the exploration, development, production, transportation or use of carbon-based fuels. We believe our view on the potential for future policy action is realistic and, by no means represents a “business as usual” case. We require all of our business lines to include, where appropriate, an estimate of GHG-related emissions costs in their economics when seeking funding for capital investments. Energy-related CO2 emissions Billion metric tons 40 Rest of world 30 Key growth India20 China 10 OECD323 0 2000 2020 2040 As the world’s population grows and living standards increase, we believe GHG emissions will plateau and start decreasing around 2030.

We apply prudent and substantial margins in our planning assumptions to help ensure competitive returns over a wide range of market conditions. We also financially “stress test” our investment opportunities, which provides an added margin against uncertainties, such as those related to technol.ogy development, costs, geopolitics, availability of required materials, services and labor. Stress testing, which differs from alternative scenario planning, further enables us to consider a wide range of market environments in our planning and investment process. Sunset over our Kearl Oil Sands project facility in Alberta, Canada, where in 2014 we completed construction of an 84-megawatt cogeneration facility. Venting and fugitive emissions In 2014, our venting and fugitive emissions totaled 3 million CO2-equivalent metric tons. This represents an increase of 0.8 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions compared with our 2013 performance. While venting and fugitive emis.sions, most of which are methane, represent less than 3 percent of our direct GHG emissions, we recognize the importance of reducing these emissions. We continue to look for cost-effective ways to reduce methane and other hydrocarbon emissions in our operations, such as replacing high-bleed pneumatic devices with lower-emission technology and conducting green well completions in targeted Upstream operations. Additionally, we are working with academia, NGOs and gov.ernments to better understand the magnitude and characteris.tics of oil and gas industry methane emissions. One example is XTO Energy’s participation in University of Texas and Envi.ronmental Defense Fund studies. These studies quantified the methane leakage rate in the United States from Upstream gas production activities at 0.4 percent of the total gas produced, validating Environmental Protection Agency estimates. Cogeneration Through the ongoing incorporation of cogeneration into many of our facilities, ExxonMobil is able to generate power more efficiently than many local utilities. Cogeneration captures heat generated from the production of electricity for use in production, refining and chemical processing operations. Due to its inherent energy efficiency, the use of cogeneration also leads to reduced GHG emissions; our cogeneration facilities alone enable the avoidance of approximately 7 million metric tons per year of GHG emissions. We have interests in approximately 5,500 megawatts of cogeneration capacity in more than 100 installations at more than 30 locations around the world. This capacity is equivalent to the annual energy needs of 2.5 million U.S. homes. In 2014, we added 250 megawatts of additional capacity at our Kearl and Cold Lake sites in Alberta, Canada, as well as 30 mega.watts of additional capacity at our Grossenkneten facility in Germany. Since 2005, we have invested more than $1 billion in cogeneration projects, and we continue to develop additional investment opportunities. Carbon capture and sequestration Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) involves capturing, transporting and sequestering CO2 in underground geologic formations such as saline reservoirs, depleted oil or gas res.ervoirs, or deep coal beds. In the future, CCS will likely be one of several important technologies used to help reduce CO2 emissions, with the greatest opportunity being in the coal- and natural gas-fired power sectors. ExxonMobil has extensive operating experience with the component technologies of carbon capture and sequestration; we captured more than 6 million metric tons for sequestration in 2014 alone. Our LaBarge plant in Wyoming, which sells CO2 to third parties for enhanced oil recovery, is one of the largest CO2 capture operations in the world. We have also successfully concluded operations at our Controlled Freeze ZoneTM (CFZTM) commercial demonstration unit at LaBarge. The technology is ready for commercial deployment and could provide a more cost-efficient approach to separating CO2 from natural gas, allowing for the CO2 to be geosequestered or used in enhanced oil recovery. Additionally, together with partners, we have been capturing and sequestering CO2 at the Sleipner field in Norway since 1996. ExxonMobil is also a joint-venture participant in the Gor.gon natural gas project in Australia, which includes CCS. Once operational, Gorgon will have the largest reservoir CO2 injection facility in the world. We continue to look for economic oppor.tunities to expand the use of existing CCS technologies and are pursuing proprietary research aimed at developing more efficient and cost-effective methods for CCS than traditional techniques have demonstrated. For additional details regarding ExxonMobil’s historical perfor.mance related to GHG emissions and climate change mitiga.tion measures, see page 72. Developing future technology ExxonMobil is conducting scientific research to discover inno.vative approaches to developing existing and next-generation energy sources, while at the same time developing products that can enable more efficient energy consumption. We spend approximately $1 billion per year on research and technology development and have approximately 11,000 active patents. ExxonMobil’s Corporate Strategic Research (CSR) laboratory is a fundamental research institution, with approximately 150 Ph.D. scientists and engineers focused on addressing the company’s long-range science needs. The laboratory’s scientists are recognized as world experts and authorities in their field. Our research portfolio includes a broad array of programs, including alternative energy, CCS, biofuels, life-cycle analysis, climate science and materials science. The CSR laboratory also conducts strategic research with leading universities around the world. In 2014, ExxonMobil signed an agreement to join the MIT Energy Initiative, a collab.oration aimed at working to advance and explore the future of energy. Additionally, ExxonMobil was a founding member of the Global Climate and Energy Project at Stanford University, which seeks to develop fundamental, game-changing scien.tific breakthroughs that could lead to lower GHG emissions and a less carbon-intensive global energy system. Other university collaborations cover a wide range of scientific topics, from understanding the impacts of black carbon and aerosols (University of California, Riverside) to the fundamentals of bio.mass pyrolysis used to make biofuels (Iowa State University). For more than a decade, we have also worked with automo.tive partners to study combustion fundamentals and devise concepts to improve the efficiency and reduce the emissions of engines. As an example, we developed an innovative onboard system that converts conventional hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline or diesel into hydrogen for a fuel cell, eliminating the need for separate facilities to produce and distribute hydrogen. Measured on a “well-to-wheels” basis, this fuel system could be significantly more fuel-efficient and emit less CO2 than a traditional internal-combustion engine. We have also worked with Corning and Toyota to develop an onboard system that can increase the fuel efficiency of gasoline engines by about 10 percent, using energy that would normally be wasted in the exhaust. For more examples of industry engagement, see the case study beginning on the next page. In addition, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics Inc. are co-funding a basic research program to develop advanced biofuels from algae. If successful, this technology could signifi.cantly reduce GHG emissions in comparison with conventional fuels. While we have progressed since beginning this work in 2009, algae biofuels research and development is a long-term endeavor that could take decades or more to commercialize at scale. We also utilize in-house capabilities to conduct life cycle assessments (LCAs) of our products and activities. Recently, we published a report that details the life cycle GHG emissions for electricity generated from shale gas, including, for the first time, actual field data for natural gas produced from the Mar.cellus and Barnett shales in the United States. These studies found the “well-to-wire” GHG emissions associated with shale gas are about half those of coal, and are not significantly dif.ferent from the well-to-wire emissions of gas produced from traditional reservoirs. Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Freshwater Consumption of Marcellus Shale Gas Up Close: Engineering resiliency into our operations While most scientists agree climate change could pose risks related to extreme weather, sea level rise, temperature extremes and precipitation changes, the limited scientific understanding of the likelihood, magnitude, frequency or geographical distribution of these events poses a challenge in planning. Our facilities are designed, constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climactic and other condi.tions, with safety factors being built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, which cover those associated with potential climate change impacts. We continue to engage with major engineering societies, international organizations and industry groups to develop sound engineering perspectives on managing the risks of extreme weather. Case study – Innovation drives sustainability in Downstream and Chemical businesses Case study Innovation drives sustainability in Downstream and Chemical businesses Sustainability is an ongoing journey at ExxonMobil. Our employ.ees are committed to innovation and continuous improvement. In both our Downstream and Chemical businesses, we have sustainability steering teams that meet regularly to drive our longer-term vision into multiyear strategic plans to improve our own operations, as well as provide sustainability benefits, such as increasing efficiency and reducing waste, for the entire value chain. We have the ability to make a sizable positive impact on society. Our products help customers and consumers con.serve energy and reduce raw material use, which in turn can help reduce costs and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around the world. Chemical product benefits Among the many product offerings in our Chemical busi.ness, our materials used in automotive applications provide ExxonMobil Chemical auto applications manufacturers and consumers with quantifiable benefits. For example, we manufacture butyl rubber — invented by ExxonMobil researchers in 1937 — which is utilized to produce tire innerliners. This material helps maintain optimal tire air pressure, which in turn contributes to improved vehicle fuel economy, tire durability and performance. Our next-generation tire innerliner materials have the potential to deliver further leading-edge air retention performance. Tires incorporating these new technologies provide the potential to reduce weight in the innerliner by up to 90 percent, while also improving rolling resistance and fuel efficiency. In the United States, it is estimated that 25 percent of vehicle tires are underinflated, leading to inefficient driving. If drivers in the United States kept their tires properly inflated, they could save up to 1 billion gallons of gasoline per year.

Plastic parts are typically much lighter than comparable metal parts, allowing drivers to save on fuel costs and reduce their cars’ emissions. To learn more, view this American Chem.istry Council video. American Chemistry Council video We also are developing innovative resins for use in plastic packaging products. According to a recent life cycle study, substituting a variety of plastics packaging with non-plastic alternatives — such as glass, paper, aluminum or steel — would increase the amount of packaging generated annually in the United States by 55 million tons. Plastics help significantly reduce packaging weight, which results in more products per shipment, fewer trucks on the road, less energy used, fewer GHG emissions and less material to reuse, recover and/or recycle. ExxonMobil Chemical is continuing to help the food packaging industry “do more with less.” Innovations such as our ExceedTM and EnableTM metallocene polyethylene (mPE) product lines have allowed the average film thickness of high-performance heavy-duty bags to decrease from 200 microns in 1990 to 80 microns today, while providing similar or sometimes better per.formance. In a peer-reviewed study conducted by ExxonMobil Chemical researchers, heavy-duty sacks used for packaging made with our ExceedTM mPE product use 45 percent less energy, 70 percent less water, weigh half as much and provide more protection to the product as compared with a similar paper sack. ExxonMobil plastic products also contribute to safety within the food industry. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, one-third of the food pro.duced in the world goes to waste each year. Plastic packaging can help reduce spoilage, increase access to food and improve food safety for consumers around the world. Food and Agriculture Organization Life-cycle impacts of plastic packaging versus alternatives1 1Based on 2010 data. Franklin Associates 2014 study for the American Chemistry Council Fuels & Lubricants product benefits ExxonMobil works on research and development of new lubricants, fuels and powertrains, often directly with automak.ers and original equipment manufacturers, in pursuit of higher vehicle efficiency and lower emissions. In 2014, important strides were made in integrating sustainability efforts of the consolidated Fuels & Lubricants company, with each global business unit contributing actions specific to its industry. A sustainability feature of synthetic lubricants, for vehicle or industrial use, is a longer drain interval than conventional mineral oils. The lubricant may be replaced less often, reducing the amount of waste oil to dispose or recycle. It also means personnel change the oil less often, increasing efficiency while limiting exposure to machinery and elements, and lowering costs. These advantages are especially important in wind turbine applications, where the machinery can be hundreds of feet in the air and exposed to weather. Mobilgear SHC XMP 320 is used in more than 40,000 wind turbines worldwide. MobilTM industrial lubricant products are designed to help cus.tomers extend the life of their equipment, reduce maintenance and improve efficiency within their operations. We collaborate with our customers to ensure our products are used to their highest potential for efficiency within the context of each cus.tomer’s specific operations. Specific examples from industrial customers around the world include: • Chantilly Crushed Stone, a Virginia aggregate quarry, relies on two large-haul trucks to move more than 60 85-ton loads of stone per day from its quarry pit. Previously, the company overhauled its truck engines after 12,000 hours and strug.gled to maintain oil drain intervals of 250 hours. After inves.tigation and analysis by ExxonMobil engineers, coupled with implementing ExxonMobil’s Mobil ServSM Lubricant Analysis, the company now uses Mobil DelvacTM 1300 Super 15W-40. It reports extending its engine overhaul intervals beyond 21,000 hours and doubling its drain intervals. Allowing for reduced waste, increased production and minimal downtime has helped generate nearly $1.2 million in production value savings for Chantilly Crushed Stone.* • Coeur Mexicana, S.A de C.V, a Mexican mining company, operates a ball mill that was previously lubricated with a standard mineral oil, leading its gearbox to run at tempera.tures reaching as high as 90 degrees Celsius.

After engaging with ExxonMobil, the company now uses Mobil SHCTM 632 synthetic oil, scientifically engineered to reduce overall friction, increase efficiency in sliding mechanisms and potentially reduce operation tempera.tures. Coeur Mexicana reports successfully reducing temperatures by more than 10 degrees Celsius and gen.erating annual savings of $470,000, as well as improving operational safety, limiting employee interaction with machinery for maintenance.* • Mamut Peru SAC, a Peruvian mining contractor, lubricates the heavy-duty engines in its entire fleet of trucks with Mobil Delvac MX™ 15W-40 heavy-duty diesel engine oil. The company maintained oil drain intervals of 10,000 kilometers before experiencing increased production and demand for more equipment availability. Working with ExxonMobil engineers, the company reports extending its drain intervals to every 20,000 kilometers, reducing waste and leading to an annual cost savings of more than $96,000.* “Having ExxonMobil and its distributor Nor Oil as a lubrication partner has been enormously beneficial. Through the use of Mobil Delvac MX™ 15W-40 heavy-duty diesel engine oil and the implementation of ExxonMobil’s Mobil ServSM Lubricant Analysis, we have seen a number of operational benefits, from increased equipment availability to reduced waste oil generation. With its vast range of expertise, products and services, ExxonMobil and its distributor Nor Oil continue to sup.port the successful operation of our fleet.” — Juan David Narva Novoa, maintenance coordinator, Mamut Peru SAC *This proof of performance is based on the experience of a single customer. Actual results may vary depending upon the type of equipment  used; its maintenance, operating conditions and environment; and any  prior lubricant used. We recognize our journey will not be achieved overnight — it will take continued engagement with our employees and customers to ensure our operations are as efficient as possible. We will continue on the path to ensure our products and services provide tangible sustainability benefits for customers and consumers. For more information on these and other lubricant products, please see our website. ExxonMobil lubricant products exxonmobil.com/citizenship 42 Women in Tanzania utilizing an irrigation pump provided by KickStart International, an ExxonMobil partner. Community and We seek to engage with stakeholders in local communities on a regular basis to share information and identify any issues or concerns.

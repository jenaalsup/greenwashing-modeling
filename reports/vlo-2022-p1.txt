Please see Forward-Looking Statements below. Forward-Looking StatementsThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, but not limited to, statements about our Policies and Procedures. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as “should,” “strive,” “pursue,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “track,” “would,” “continue,” “poised,” “focused,” “opportunity,” “scheduled,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “seek,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “targeting,” “goal,” “plan,” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Forward-looking statements in this document include those relating to our 2025 and 2035 GHG emissions reduction/displacement targets, expected timing of completion of projects, future market, industry and legislative conditions, future safety performance, future operating performance and management of future risks. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or actions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the control of Valero and are difficult to predict including, but not limited to, the effect, impact, potential duration or other implications of the uncertainties that remain with respect to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic, legislative or political changes, market dynamics, cyberattacks, weather events and various events arising from the foregoing. These statements are often based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including examination of historical operating trends and market conditions made by the management of Valero. Although Valero believes that the assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, Valero cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish its expectations, beliefs or intentions, or that any forward-looking statements will ultimately prove to be accurate.

FROM
OUR CEOI am very proud of Team Valero and the work we do to advance the future of our company. Throughout the last year, our employees demonstrated resilience through safe and environmentally responsible operations for each other and our communities.  In 2021, we more than doubled the production capacity of our renewable diesel facility in Louisiana, on budget and ahead of schedule. Right now, construction is underway on a new renewable diesel plant in Texas, with an accelerated expected completion in the fourth quarter of 2022. With startup activities expected to begin in late 2024, the large-scale carbon sequestration project with BlackRock, and Navigator is also progressing on schedule. These are great initiatives that show how we are leveraging our liquid-fuels platform and operational expertise to diversify into high-growth, high-return, low-carbon projects that further strengthen our long-term competitive advantage as a leading producer of transportation fuels. These projects move us even closer to achieving our refinery greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions goals for 2025 and 2035.But we are not stopping there. We continue to explore additional innovative low-carbon opportunities, like sustainable aviation fuel, cellulosic ethanol, low-carbon hydrogen and other initiatives to decrease emissions resulting from the use of our products. Turning to the community, last year alone we generated more than $62 million for charities that improve the lives in our neighboring communities. In 2021, we partnered with nonprofit organizations and funded impactful initiatives that addressed the needs of our neighbors. Efforts were focused on providing food, shelter, workforce training and access to health care, as well as preserving the environment through biodiversity and habitat restoration and protection projects. With more than half of the members of the board of directors representing diversity in gender, race and ethnicity, our board and the entire management team continue to drive our companywide diversity and inclusion efforts. We believe this is important to attract and retain the brightest minds, who we are certain will continue advancing the future of energy and our company.We know tomorrow is built on actions we take today. We are committed to meeting the growing demand for reliable, affordable low-carbon fuels not in some distant future, but right now. We hope you enjoy learning more about Valero’s culture of innovation and unmatched execution in the next pages of our ESG Report. Thank you for your continued support and trust.

SafetySafety is our foundation for success.EnvironmentWe are committed stewards of the environment.CommunityWe will be a good neighbor by sharing our success with the communities where we live and work through volunteerism, charitable giving and the economic support of being a good employer.EmployeesWe consider our employees a competitive advantage and our greatest asset. We foster a culture that supports diversity and inclusion, and we provide a safe, healthy and rewarding work environment with opportunities for growth.GovernanceWe view our stakeholders as partners to whom we seek to deliver operational excellence, disciplined management of capital and long-term value on a foundation of strong governance and ethical standards.GHG Emissions Targets Valero’s refineries are among the most efficient and are expected to be resilient according to the benchmarking analysis conducted as part of our TCFD hypothetical scenario analysis. We believe that our assets and strategies for our petroleum-based and low-carbon fuels are well positioned to make Valero a resilient company in a lower-carbon economy.In 2021, absolute improvements have reduced our global refinery Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 11.5% against our 2011 baseline (verified global refinery Scope 1 and 2 in 2021 account for 28.5 million metric tons CO2e).The growth of our low-carbon fuels production and blending have also displaced fossil fuels from less efficient refiners.  2035 GHG Emissions TargetWe are on track to achieving our 2025 target, which focuses on reducing and displacing our global refinery Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 63%. By 2035, we plan to increase that percentage to 100% through board-approved projects and carbon sequestration projects under development.2.432.34.211.1Million Metric Tons CO2e100%

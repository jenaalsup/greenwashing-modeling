Sustainability OfficerThe balanced planet. It’s an idea around which 
we’ve centered our entire brand. But how can we 
get there? And how can driving energy innovation deliver on this commitment? The world’s energy mix must transform into one that can continue to meet demand safely, securely, and reliably while decarbonizing for the future. At the same time, we aren’t ready to fully transition from our existing energy infrastructure. We must continue to deliver supply for a growing world by decarbonizing oil and gas today as we innovate the new energy systems of tomorrow.These aren’t easy challenges, and they can’t be solved alone. Achieving balance will require new and diverse investments, collaboration, and support across all energy systems, and the energy industry must be a key contributor. As an industry, we have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to solve complex challenges, and with our experience, knowledge, and scale, no one is better suited or more strongly motivated to lead this next chapter. The effects of climate change are accelerating, and we view the energy transition as a key strategic priority; it’s not only the right thing to do, but also crucial to ensuring the long-term resilience of our business.At SLB, we have placed the global energy challenge at the heart of who we are, and to solve it, we are embedding sustainability in everything we do. In 2022, we announced a bold new brand identity, SLB, centered on driving the global shift to sustainable energy production. As a technology leader and an energy-innovator, we find this challenge exciting. We’re setting ambitious goals to deliver measurable social and environmental progress, and we’re partnering with customers, suppliers, and peers to accelerate our impact. After building our strategy in 2021, we shaped a culture to support it, rooting each of our core values in sustainability, and spent the past year operationalizing our ambitions and delivering strong results across our three priorities: Climate Action, People, and Nature. We are executing on roadmaps to decarbonize operations and achieve net-zero emissions, while providing in-country value, respecting human rights, and fully embracing all aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Oil and gas operations comprise around 10% of global energy-related emissions. As the first company in the energy services industry to include Scope 3 emissions in our 2050 net zero target, we are making a significant impact throughout the value chain, not only increasing our operational efficiency, but also developing new technologies to help our customers optimize their environmental footprint. And we continue to leverage our global scale with localized expertise to deploy custom sustainability solutions in each of our operating areas. Throughout the last century, the energy industry fueled growth, ideas, and progress for all of humanity; now it must fuel change. Together, we will pave the way to a balanced planet through better practices, innovative technology, and the commitment to help others across the globe on their sustainability journey. We are proud of the success we have achieved and look forward to continuing our strong momentum in the years ahead.Olivier Le Peuch Chief Executive OfficerCEO and CSSO Introduction continuedThroughout the last century, the energy industry fueled growth, ideas, and progress for all of humanity; now it must fuel change.Dr. Katharina BeumelburgChief Strategy and

We look to three core values that guide the decisions we make as we pursue our ambitions. We are proud of our strong culture which anchors our values and embeds sustainability even deeper into SLB.	People are at the heart of our business. We are committed to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Across the world we’re building a truly diverse workforce, safeguarding mental health and wellbeing, and endeavoring to create more inclusive environments —in the workplace, in our supply chains, and in the communities where we work and.live.	As well as being part of our DNA, technology and innovation are key enablers of our sustainability framework. From invention to application, our.technologies enable safer, more efficient, and.more sustainable operations for both ourselves and our.customers. 	We leverage sustainability as a key performance benchmark, as we believe performance is about more than just financial results.IN FOCUSOur approachto sustainabilityThe carbon budget curveThe carbon budget curve shows the reduction in CO2e emissions needed over the coming century to limit the global rise in temperature to only 1.5 degC, as set by the Paris Agreement. Climate change projections show that the world will reach the budget for this target just eight years from now—in 2030. That means we must balance the emissions of the next few decades with sustained net negative carbon actions beyond 2050, to protect ourselves and the planet. Learn more here.For a Balanced PlanetThe world is facing its greatest balancing act: how to provide reliable, accessible, and affordable energy while rapidly decarbonizing for a sustainable future. As a global technology company, driving energy innovation for a balanced planet, SLB has a powerful role to play in reducing emissions across many industries while scaling new energy systems to help meet demand. And we’re ready to rise to the challenge.We are the industry leader driving innovation in our oil and gas core. A key aspect of our innovation efforts is our commitment to decarbonizing our operations and those of our customers. We are a data solutions provider in the energy domain and beyond with our digital business, which helps drive performance, efficiency, and sustainability. We are a technology solutions provider that develops and scales the new energy systems of tomorrow. As a symbol of our commitment to the challenge ahead, we’ve based our new identity on the carbon budget curve—the maximum net global CO2 emissions permissible to limit global warming to 1.5 degC. Our logo represents the journey we have committed to and that we support for our customers. Our curve represents the journey to net zero and beyond, to bring balance back to the planet.Our sustainability reporting is guided by our stakeholders and third-party frameworks, including	Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 	Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) 	UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)	UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Reporting Framework.Our approach to sustainability continuedSustainability FrameworkBalanced Sustainability PrioritiesOur sustainability strategy is focused on where we believe we can make the biggest impact for our company, our stakeholders, and society. Our.priorities are climate action, people, and nature. Supporting our priorities are our enablers—robust governance and empowering local initiatives—and our accelerators— technology innovation, and.partnerships.We are scaling our in.country value investments and our local partnerships to drive positive actions in support of the UN SDGs. We are doing this with a significant focus on affordable and clean energy, to have a greater impact where we live and work and in support of a just transition. We have also accelerated our journey through technology, innovation, and the right partnerships to take significant steps to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.In 2022, within each priority, we have taken the next step of operationalizing sustainability throughout our company, as illustrated by the following examples:	We are empowering our local teams to take ownership of their sustainability strategies enabled by learning and development opportunities and a capital allocation program. Employees from more than 50 countries submitted almost 300 projects to the Sustainability Impact Awards representing 
an investment of over USD 25 million in.2023.	We have incentivized our employees by implementing key performance objectives in our compensation programs for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our field operations and.facilities. 	We have developed an impact quantification methodology to calculate customer avoided emissions which allows us to recognize the value we provide for our.customers. 	Our new product development process has sustainability elements integrated to understand the environmental impact of our technology investments.	We have taken our human rights program to the next level focusing on higher-risk facilities and our supply chain to empower local teams to understand, assess and react to human rights issues. This is complemented by partnering with third-party organizations to assess human rights risk exposure levels.	Our nature priority has evolved with a focus on water stewardship within the company, in our supply chain and within our communities. 	The primary focus of our circularity program is the lifecycle of the tools and products that we design and build. This global initiative is led by the Technology Lifecycle Management Program (TLM). In addition, we are implementing programs at the local level that not only address circularity but also provide opportunities for local economic development. We are focused on scaling the local programs that can provide high-impact sustainability across our.organization.	With our commitment to continuous improvement, we are constantly reviewing ways to enhance our overall governance framework. An important part of this framework is our enterprise risk mapping program that identifies material risks that could impact our strategy. In 2022, we conducted an AI-enabled assessment of potential ESG risks and stakeholder concerns. Based on this assessment, we have re-committed to our strategic sustainability focuses of Climate Action, People and Nature. Nature	Safeguarding Biodiversity	Protecting Natural Resources	Enabling CircularityPeople	Creating In-Country Value	Respecting Human Rights	Promoting Diversity, Equity, and InclusionClimate Action	Our Roadmap to Net Zero	Decarbonizing Operations	New Energy and Transition OpportunitiesOur accelerators	Technology and Innovation

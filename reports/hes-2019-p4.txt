CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY Carbon Asset Risk Assessment Climate-related issues have evolved from an environmental concern to also include financial considerations. Our stakeholders have therefore expressed an interest in understanding how HessÕ oil and gas portfolio might be impacted by a transition to a lower carbon economy. Although an energy transition to a lower carbon economy is underway, it is widely considered that there are multiple pathways to achieve this transition, creating uncertainty as to trajectories to a low carbon environment and the pace and scale of change. To help quantify climate-related risks and opportunities Ð and to provide perspectives to our investors and other key stakeholders Ð Hess conducts an annual scenario planning exercise as a methodology to assess portfolio resilience over the longer term. This scenario-based approach allows us to assess and communicate to our shareholders our understanding of future risks and opportunities in relation to the potential evolution of energy demand and mix, the emergence of new technologies, and possible changes by policymakers with respect to GHG emissions. Because the TCFD recommends transparency around key parameters, assumptions and analytical choices, Hess has chosen to model the three main scenarios detailed in the IEAÕs 2019 World Energy Outlook against our own internal base planning case. Furthermore, the TCFD recommends that organizations use a 2¡C, or lower, scenario to test portfolio resilience Ð in other words, a scenario under which global warming is kept to well below a 2¡C increase compared with preindustrial levels. Such scenarios usually feature reductions    in demand for oil, natural gas and coal; growth in clean technologies; and a reshaping of trade flows, among other assumptions. The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) in the IEAÕs 2019 WEO, which is part of HessÕs modeling, fits within this recommendation. Considerations for Carbon Risk Scenario Assessment To evaluate the potential exposure of our portfolio to transition risks in a carbon-constrained future, we began by considering the long range outlook for energy supply and demand, as well as for oil, gas and carbon prices. We have used the IEAÕs 2019 WEO to examine supply and demand and oil, gas and carbon price scenarios through 2040 in the Current Policies Scenario and the Stated Policies Scenario, and through 2050 in the SDS, which are the years through which these respective IEA scenarios extend (see www.iea.org/weo2019/). These scenarios are recognized as a leading industry standard and benchmark worldwide, and are, therefore, an appropriate choice for an       oil and gas producer such as Hess. Such scenarios and therefore our own assessment of carbon   risk are premised on a longer term view of energy supply and demand. We expect that recent events related to the global COVID-19 pandemic and near term global oversupply of oil     will have a short term impact on the various IEA energy supply and demand scenarios as published in the 2019 WEO. In 2020, we plan to update our scenario analysis to reflect the IEAÕs interpretation of the impact of recent market conditions            on its longer term forecasts. According to the IEA, the emphasis on strong early action and the subsequent rapid reduction in emissions means that the SDS is aligned with the Paris Agreement objective to hold temperature rise to well below 2¡C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5¡C. If technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere (i.e., those that allow for ÒnegativeÓ emissions) were to be deployed at scale in the second half of the 21st century, then the SDS would provide a 50% chance of a 1.5¡C outcome (see the IEA chart on the following page). The cumulative level of net emissions required to do this would be less than the median level in the 1.5¡C scenario assessed by the IPCC. The group of three charts on the next page depicts the 2019 WEOÕs world energy demand and CO2 emissions under the IEAÕs three main scenarios. In the Stated Policies Scenario, which is the IEAÕs central scenario, worldwide energy use is expected to grow by approximately 24% between 2018 and 2040 (see the IEA chart on the following page). While there is a decline in demand for coal, oil and natural gas in this scenario between 2018 and 2040 Ð most notably in the European Union (E.U.) Ð it is offset by increased demand elsewhere during that same period. Ultimately, demand for oil and gas is projected to grow in the Stated Policies Scenario by 9% and 26%, respectively, over that period and account for 53% of the energy mix in 2040, down only slightly from 54% today. In the Sustainable Development Scenario (consistent with limiting the rise in global average temperature to well below The IEA 2019 World Energy OutlookÕs Three Main Scenarios ¥ The Current Policies Scenario is the business-as-usual case. ¥ The Stated Policies Scenario incorporates energy policy and implementing measures affecting energy markets that may have been adopted (chiefly the Nationally Determined Contributions Ð i.e., the emission reductions agreed to by individual countries under the Paris Agreement), even though specific measures necessary to put them into effect may need to be fully developed and implemented. ¥ The Sustainable Development Scenario reflects a pathway to achieving key energy-related components of the U.N. Sustainable Development Agenda Ð including universal access to modern energy by 2030, urgent action to tackle climate change and measures to improve poor air quality Ð and is consistent with limiting the rise in global average temperature to below 1.8¡C at a 66% probability or 1.65¡C stabilization at a 50% probability, without any recourse to net-negative emissions. 2¡C), worldwide energy use is projected to experience a modest decline of 7% between 2018 and 2040. Oil and gas are still expected to account for nearly half of the energy mix (47%). While the Sustainable Development Scenario projects lower oil demand in the 2040 timeframe, the IEA states that Òcontinued investment in both new and existing oil fields, even as overall production declines in line with climate goals, is a necessary part of the energy transition envisaged in the SDSÓ (2019 WEO, page 95). In terms of the continuing upstream oil and gas investment required to meet such demand, in the Stated Policies Scenario annual spending averages $650 billion between 2019 and 2030 and $730 billion thereafter. In the Sustainable Development Scenario, although fewer new developments are required, continuing investment in both new and existing oil and gas fields remains an essential element of the energy transition. Approximately $510 billion is estimated to be spent on average each year between 2019 and 2030, while $390 billion is spent between 2030 and 2040. In contrast, since the oil price crash of 2014, upstream oil and gas investment has been curtailed. Investment has ranged between $350 billion in 2016 and $420 billion in 2019, with investment for 2020 now expected to be further reduced to between $300 billion and $350 billion. Even with a major capital reallocation from fuels to power, the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario requires upstream oil and gas investment over the next decade significantly above the average over the past five years. The oil and gas industry is a long cycle business, such that this continued underinvestment is a risk that could manifest itself as a medium term supply gap, where recent levels of investment are insufficient to meet medium term demand. World Primary Energy Demand by Fuel, and Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, by IEA Scenario Current Policies Stated Policies Sustainable Development 20 40 30 20 10 0 2000 2018 2030 2040 2000 2018 2030 2040 ÷ Coal ÷ Oil ÷ Gas ÷ Nuclear ÷ Renewables ÷ Solid Biomass CO2 Emissions Billion Tons of Oil Equivalent Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide 2000 2040 Trajectories for Total CO2 Emissions in the Sustainable Change in Production of and Demand for Coal, Oil and Natural Development Scenario and to Limit Warming to 1.5¡C Gas in Selected Regions in the Stated Policies Scenario, 2018Ð2040 45 Sustainable Development Scenario 900 Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide Million Tons of Oil Equivalent 600 300 0 -300 From SDS toward 1.5¡C -600 2000 2020 2040 2060 2080 2100 Middle India United Africa Russia China SE E.U.

We have prepared internal guidance that details our approach and establishes a specified methodology. This also serves as a roadmap for our external verifier to review and verify that we followed our specified methodology when conducting this scenario analysis. Our first step in this process was to establish a Hess base case, which for 2019 was premised off a long term $60 per barrel Brent and $2.75 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) Henry Hub natural gas price, both in 2020 real terms. In addition, we applied either actual carbon pricing for our assets and intended forward investments where a regulatory framework for such exists, or a sustained $40 per tonne cost of CO2. HessÕ base case was then compared against the various oil, natural gas and carbon prices in the IEAÕs three main scenarios Ð Current Policies, Stated Policies and Sustainable Development Ð running our current asset portfolio and intended forward investments through these varying sets of assumptions to assess financial robustness. The three charts below show the oil, natural gas and CO2 prices under the IEAÕs Current Policies, Stated Policies and Sustainable Development scenarios against HessÕ base case. As these charts show, there is a wide spread of oil, natural gas and carbon pricing across the three IEA scenarios, a key ingredient for informative scenario planning. Results of the Hess Scenario Planning Exercise Through our methodology, we have tested the robustness of HessÕ asset portfolio and intended forward investments under multiple energy scenarios, including the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario. We note that the latter is aligned with 50 *The NPV index normalizes the value of the Hess portfolio under HessÕ base case to 100%, and indexes the value of the Hess portfolio under the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario to the Hess base case. the Paris AgreementÕs aim of limiting the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2¡C, as the scenario incorporates a 66% probability of 1.8¡C stabilization and a 50% probability of a 1.65¡C stabilization, without any recourse to net-negative emissions. In the chart above, the first column shows the net present value (NPV) of the Hess portfolio under our base case commodity  and CO2 price assumptions, normalized to 100%, and the second column shows the NPV of the Hess portfolio under the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario and CO2 price assumptions as an index to the Hess base case. The NPV of the Hess portfolio under the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario assumptions is 20% higher than under the Hess base case assumptions. This result demonstrates the robustness of HessÕ portfolio against even the most challenging of the IEAÕs scenarios, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, driven by our conservative planning assumptions as they relate to commodity prices and the competitive pipeline of future investments in our portfolio. Hess Base Case Crude Oil Price Natural Gas Price CO2 Price 200 8 160 Dollars per MMBtu, 2020 Real TermsU.S. Dollars per Barrel, 2020 Real TermsU.S. Dollars per Tonne, 2020 Real TermsU.S.150 6 120 80100 4 Hess Base Case IEA Current Policies Scenario 50 2 40 IEA Stated Policies Scenario IEA Sustainable 0 00 Development Scenerio 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Hess Strategic PrioritiesValidation of Hess Strategy With the lower oil demand assumed in the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario, industry competition may intensify, and some higher cost producers may be forced out of the marketplace. We therefore believe our scenario analysis validates HessÕ strategic priorities to focus investment on high return, low cost oil and gas opportunities and to build a focused and balanced portfolio, robust at low prices. We believe this strategy is consistent with the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario, which envisions a meaningful role for oil and gas through 2040, when oil and gas are still projected to account for 47% of global primary energy demand. COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY Although recent events and market conditions have necessitated major reductions to our 2020 capital and exploratory budget, longer term, Hess plans to allocate the majority of our capital expenditures to developing the companyÕs growth assets offshore Guyana and in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.

Our analysis attempted to use a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calibrate the historical relationship between the stock price return of Hess to changes in our RepRisk score, oil prices and Standard and PoorÕs Oil and Gas Stock Price Index. RepRisk Ð a global data science company focused on due diligence of material environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks Ð produces a quantitative summary of the ESG risk exposure of a company, including climate-related risks. RepRiskÕs assessment of the ESG risk exposure of a company is based on the companyÕs activities observed by media, stakeholders and third-party sources and excludes information provided by the company itself. HessÕ current RepRisk score of 19 (as of May 2019), places our company in the low risk exposure category, which is comparable to or better than most other oil and gas companies. The goal of our analysis was to measure the potential impact of changes in RepRisk scores for Hess resulting from the publication of a series of historical news articles related to climate change risks and then correlate this impact to a change in market valuation for Hess. The CAPM model showed a moderately statistically significant correlation between our stock price and our RepRisk score, when general market conditions were assumed to be held constant; however, this did not result in substantial changes in HessÕ market valuation. While we found this exercise helpful, measuring and valuing reputational risks and opportunities is challenging because of the difficulty of isolating the long term climate change-related reputation impacts from other company-specific, industry-related and stock market fluctuations. In addition, we found that these types of climate-related risks, for the most part, have already been identified through HessÕ ERM process and are being managed and mitigated through that process. Going forward, we will continue to explore more tangible ways to quantify reputational risk. METRICS AND TARGETS As part of HessÕ climate change strategy, we have established three targets aligned with the TCFDÕs criteria for target setting. We have committed to: ¥ Reduce the GHG emissions intensity of our operated assets by 25% by 2020 (versus a 2014 emissions baseline) ¥ Reduce the flaring intensity of our operated assets by 50% by 2020 (versus a 2014 emissions baseline) ¥ Lower methane emissions intensity from our U.S. onshore upstream operations to less than 0.47% by 2025 The 2019 WEOÕs updated Sustainable Development Scenario, similar to their 2018 SDS, requires an ambitious 21% carbon intensity reduction by 2030 in order to be consistent with a less than 2¡C aim. This 21% carbon intensity reduction figure is derived from the Sustainable Development ScenarioÕs CO2 emissions divided by primary world energy demand in 2030 versus 2017. HessÕ 25% GHG intensity reduction target, referenced above, which was set in 2015 and is based on our operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions divided by production, exceeds the IEAÕs Sustainable Development Scenario goal of a 21% carbon intensity reduction by 2030 and is therefore consistent with the Paris AgreementÕs 2¡C ambition. Based on the Hess GHG Inventory Protocol, which is published on our company website, and as part of our target setting process, we restated our 2014 baseline and subsequent yearsÕ emissions in our 2018 Sustainability Report to remove the impact of the divestitures that took place in 2017 and 2018. However, we have maintained our commitment to achieving our original 25% GHG emissions intensity and 50% flaring intensity reduction targets. In the operated GHG emissions and flaring charts that follow, we reference divested assets for the purpose of continuity. All target-related discussions are based on restated numbers, which remove the impact of the divestitures. GREENHOUSE GAS PERFORMANCE We report GHG emissions from our oil and gas assets on both operated and equity bases. Our GHG emission estimates include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide Ð reported in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). In 2014, Hess began using global warming potentials based on the values in the Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 (AR-4), prepared by the IPCC, to estimate CO2e totals. Approximately 94% of HessÕ direct reported (Scope 1) operated GHG emissions are from stationary combustion sources such as flaring, heaters, turbines and engines. The factors used to estimate emissions for these sources enterprisewide are those prescribed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart C). The remaining 6% of our reported operated GHG emissions are from a variety of noncombustion and fugitive emission sources such as storage tanks, compressor seals, pneumatic pumps and valves. For such sources at onshore facilities, we use the emission factors prescribed by the U.S. EPA in its GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 98, Subpart W). Hess uses other appropriate regulatory or industry-specific factors to estimate fugitive emissions for all other facilities. We also report indirect emissions decreased 57% through a combination of associated with purchased electricity emission reduction initiatives, asset sales 2019 Operated Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas (Scope 2) and other indirect (Scope 3) and refinery shutdowns.

We are taking multiple steps, which are described below, to mitigate this flaring increase and to drive significant flaring reductions in the next few years. On an intensity basis, we have reduced our cumulative flaring intensity by 35% through 2019, compared with our 2014 baseline. In North Dakota, exceptional well performance driven by a change in completion strategy (using plug and perf completions instead of the previous multistage sliding sleeve design) resulted in a significant increase in initial production rates, which in turn required additional short term flaring to maintain safe operations. Additionally, delays in the construction and commissioning of the Little Missouri Four gas plant (discussed further at right) caused higher than expected flaring during the year. Although flaring rates increased year on year, rates have remained within regulatory limits and are comparable to our peers and top producers in the Bakken. ¥ The Tioga Gas Plant is quickly reaching full capacity. The gas plant is planned to be shut down in the third quarter of 2020 to complete a turnaround; the shutdown will allow for the completion of required maintenance and a planned expansion project of approximately $150 million to increase plant capacity from 250 MMSCFD to 400 MMSCFD and to process a combination of additional Hess and third-party natural gas that is currently being flared.  ¥ Much of our gas produced south of the Missouri River prior to 2019 had to be flared due to insufficient gas capture and processing facilities. Hess Midstream LP partnered with Targa Resources to build a new $200 million gas plant Ð the Little Missouri Four gas plant Ð which came online in August 2019 and can process up to 200 MMSCFD of natural gas that had previously been flared.  ¥ Over the last 18 months, Hess Midstream LP has added approximately 140 MMSCFD of additional gas compression capacity. We built two new compression stations at Blue Buttes and East Nesson and added two additional compressors, each, at the Wheelock, Sorkness and Myrtle compressor stations, which will significantly expand our ability to bring more natural gas to market. Over the next several years, we plan to continue to pursue additional natural gas processing and compression capacity, capacity in an attempt to mitigate additional flaring. In addition, the following ongoing activities are designed to reduce flaring. Natural Gas Capture We have continued to use technology developed through our partnership with GTUIT Ð a designer, manufacturer and operator of well site natural gas capture and natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction equipment Ð to recover high BTU gas from locations in North Dakota that were previously flaring this raw, wet natural gas. The GTUIT equipment successfully addresses some of the technical challenges associated with capturing NGLs from the Bakken gas Ð the units are modular and mobile, they can operate reliably unmanned and they can adapt to the ever-changing flow conditions of the well and the changing chemistry of the associated gas. In 2019, we operated 11 GTUIT mobile units and two ColdStream energy recovery units (14 MMSCFD of capacity in total), allowing us to capture 7.2 million gallons of NGLs. As a result, about 513 MMSCF of gas flaring was avoided, and CO2e emissions were reduced by an estimated 44,661 tonnes. This project provides dual economic and environmental benefits, as it converts gas into marketable products as Hess Flaring Rates 100 300which will help to alleviate flaring intensity 99 Although more than $3 billion has been Flaring Intensity (SCF per BOE) in the region. Flaring (MMSCFD) 276 spent on midstream infrastructure in 80 74 71 At many of our production facilities, North Dakota over the past eight years, 60 5160 Hess relies on third parties to provide our strong production performance has 174 the gas gathering and processing 40outpaced our buildout of infrastructure to process the significant increase in gas production.

The primary intent of installing the system was to reduce GHG emissions and subsequently the quantity of CO2 allowances that would need to be purchased to meet regulatory requirements. The $3.7 million system reroutes gas from the flare to a compressor to be utilized as lift gas or fuel gas and works optimally when the offshore operation incurs steady production with minimal upset events. Primarily through the use of this system, flaring at our South Arne operations has been reduced by 80% between 2015 and 2019. See additional examples of emission reduction initiatives at hess.com/ sustainability/climate-change-energy/ emission-reduction-initiatives ENERGY USE Reducing our energy use has the dual benefit of lowering costs and GHG emissions, and it is a central focus of both our EHS & SR strategy and our Lean approach to managing the business. We generate and purchase energy primarily for power, processing, heating and cooling. In 2019, energy consumption from Hess operated assets was approximately Energy Use Thousand Gigajoules 35,000 33,121 30,000 25,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 . Direct .  Indirect 28 million gigajoules, 8% lower than in 2018. This reduced energy usage was primarily related to selectively replacing aging gas-fired compressor stations in North Dakota with electric compression. Seventy-seven percent of HessÕ energy use was directly generated from our operations, primarily at the Tioga Gas Plant and at our production facilities in North Dakota, the North Malay Basin, Denmark and the Gulf of Mexico. The remaining 23% was indirect energy (i.e., energy used by utilities to provide net purchased electricity) purchased for our North Dakota production operations and the Tioga Gas Plant. In 2019, our U.S. operations accounted for all of our purchased electricity Ð approximately 700,000 megawatt hours (MWh), or a 17% increase from last year, primarily attributable to increased production in North Dakota and the conversion of new compressor stations from gas to electric compression. Based on U.S. electricity generation profiles, we estimate that approximately 25% of this electricity was generated from renewable sources, primarily wind power. We also support renewable energy through the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs), so that in total 100% of the net electricity used in our operations is attributable to renewable sources. To offset our purchased electricity that came from nonrenewable sources, we purchased 530,714 Green-e Energy certified RECs for wind power, equivalent to 530,714 MWh or about 75% of the electricity purchased for our operated exploration and production assets in 2019. In total, including the RECs, 100% of our indirect energy use came from renewable sources. See more detail on our purchased electricity use at hess.com/sustainability/climate.change-energy/energy-use Managing Methane Emissions In recent years, advancements in shale energy technology have generated a significant increase in the supply of low cost natural gas. As a cleaner-burning fuel, natural gas can play a critical role in the transition to a low carbon economy. However, there is considerable debate about fugitive methane leakage along the natural gas value chain, which may have the potential to reduce the fuelÕs climate benefits. Hess is actively pursuing voluntary methane emission reductions as part of our EHS & SR strategy. As one aspect of this effort, Hess became a founding member of the ONE Future Coalition, a group of companies from across the natural gas industry focused on identifying policy and technical solutions that yield continuous improvement in the management of methane emissions associated with the production, processing, transportation and distribution of natural gas. ONE Future offers a performance-based, flexible approach that is expected to yield significant reductions in methane emissions. The goal is to voluntarily lower methane emissions to less than 1% of gross methane production across the U.S. value chain by 2025. Peer-reviewed analyses indicate that a leak/loss rate of 1% or less across the U.S. natural gas value chain provides immediate GHG reduction benefits. To achieve this goal, ONE Future has established 2025 methane emission rate targets for each sector of the natural gas value chain: production (0.28%), gathering and boosting (0.08%), processing (0.11%), transmission and storage (0.30%) and distribution (0.22%), which cumulatively total to the 1% target. In 2018, the ONE Future membersÕ cumulative methane emissions intensity was 0.33% across the U.S. onshore natural gas value chain, down from 0.55% in 2017. ONE Future has also set interim 2020 sectoral targets. Hess has activities in three of the ONE Future sectors: production, gathering and boosting, and processing. In 2019, we reduced our methane emissions rate across all sectors. For production our methane emissions rate was 0.35%, for gathering and boosting it was 0.14% and for processing it was 0.03%. Our total onshore U.S. methane intensity was 0.52%, which is below the ONE Future combined 2020 interim target of 0.64% for those three sectors, but slightly above the 2025 target of 0.47%. Our relative methane intensity decreased in 2019. This drop is correlated with the continued implementation of our leak detection and repair (LDAR) program across all of our production facilities (existing and new) in North Dakota and our program to phase out high bleed pneumatic controllers. We anticipate that we will achieve the ONE Future targets by 2025. Our combined U.S. methane emissions intensity across our onshore and offshore operations was 0.27%, while our global methane intensity in 2019 was 0.15%. In a related voluntary effort, in 2017 Hess became one of the founding participants in the Environmental Partnership. A key activity of the Environmental Partnership is furthering action to reduce air emissions, including methane and volatile organic compound emissions (VOCs), associated with natural gas and oil production. To accomplish this, the Environmental Partnership developed three separate Environmental Performance Programs for participating companies to implement and phase into their operations starting January 1, 2018. Hess is implementing the two programs applicable to our operations in North Dakota, as follows: ¥ Leak Program for Natural Gas and Oil Production Sources: Participants will implement monitoring and timely repair of fugitive emissions at selected sites utilizing detection methods and technologies such as U.S. EPA Method 21 or optical gas imaging cameras. Hess conducted semiannual surveys at 869 sites in 2019. ¥ Program to Replace, Remove or Retrofit High Bleed Pneumatic Controllers: Participants will replace, remove or retrofit high bleed pneumatic controllers with low or zero emitting devices within five years. After identifying 248 high bleed pneumatic controllers remaining in our North Dakota operations, we have begun phasing them out of service. In 2019 and early 2020, we took 86 high bleed pneumatic controllers out of service; we plan to phase the remaining out by 2022. The third program, involving manual liquids unloading for natural gas production sources, is not applicable to Hess, as we do not currently operate any natural gas-only production wells. In addition to these programs, the Environmental Partnership provides a platform for industry to collaborate with stakeholders and learn from one another. So far, Partnership companies have made significant progress, including eliminating or retrofitting more than 28,000 high bleed pneumatic controllers and conducting more than 156,000 leak detection surveys. In order to meet both our ONE Future and Environmental Partnership commitments, in 2019 we continued implementation of our LDAR program across all of our production facilities (existing and new) in North Dakota and at the Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota.

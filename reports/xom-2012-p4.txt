ExxonMobil’s strategy to manage climate change risks is focused on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through increased energy efficiency, enhanced operations of our facilities and technological innovation. As we work to reduce emissions, our challenge is to create solutions that protect the environment without undermining global economic growth. Mitigating GHG Emissions in our Operations At ExxonMobil, our strategy to reduce GHG emissions focuses on increasing our own energy efficiency in the short term, implementing current proven emissions-reducing technologies in the medium term, and developing breakthrough, game-changing technologies in the long term. We focus on flare reduction, cogeneration of power and steam, and improving energy efficiency as the key levers. In 2012, we invested $330 million to improve energy efficiency, reduce flaring and decrease GHG emissions. GHG emissions In 2012, ExxonMobil’s net equity GHG emissions. were 125 million metric tons. Relative to our 2011 performance, this represents a decrease of about 4 million metric tons, or 3 percent. Flaring and venting During crude oil extraction, a blend of hydrocarbon gases often accompanies oil to the surface. In certain situations, we flare or vent this gas either as a safety measure or as a means of disposal when there are no economic means of capturing and using it. In order to pursue commercial available markets, nearby infrastructure and appropriate regulations. Many of these conditions are not currently available in some locations where we operate. Therefore, reducing the amount of flared gas is an ongoing challenge for ExxonMobil’s operations in these areas. Venting is the release of methane emissions without flaring. Venting volumes are typically small in our industry and are often associated with protocols to ensure the safety of an operation and our personnel. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Net) Net equity, CO2-equivalent emissions (millions of metric tons)  Upstream  Downstream  Chemical  Year  2009  123  2010  126  2011  129  2012  125  In accordance with the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Initiative, of which ExxonMobil is a charter member, and as specified in our Upstream Flaring and Venting Reduction Environmental Standard for Projects, our aim is to avoid routine flaring and venting of produced fluids in new projects. We also design new projects to avoid venting reservoir carbon dioxide (CO2) that is produced, where practical. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Normalized) Net equity, CO2-equivalent emissions (metric tons per 100 metric tons of throughput or production) Year 2009  Upstream  20.1  2010   20.5  2011   20.6  2012   22.3  Year 2009  Downstream 21.0  2010  20.8  2011  20.3  2012   19.5  Year 2009  Chemical  60.7  2010  57.9  2011  57.2  2012  56.2  In 2012, our Upstream and Downstream flaring averaged 361 million cubic feet per day, a decrease of 14 percent from 2011 and a reduction of 60 percent from 2006. Our operations in Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea account for most of our flared gas, contributing about 60 percent of our total Upstream flaring. Energy efficiency In 2012, energy used in our operations totaled 1.5billion gigajoules, which remains unchanged relative to our 2011 energy usage. ExxonMobil pursues a variety of projects to improve energy efficiency. Since 2000, we have used our Global Energy Management System (GEMS) in the Downstream and Chemical business lines to identify and act on energy-savings opportunities. The GEMS equivalent in the Upstream business is the Production Operations Energy Management System (POEMS). From 2002 to 2012, we improved energy efficiency by approximately 10 percent in refining and 12 percent in chemical manufacturing. For example, to help reduce energy consumption at Hydrocarbon Flaring (millions of metric tons) Upstream  Downstream  Chemical  Year  2009  4.4  2010  3.6  2011  4.1  2012  3.6  alternatives for associated gas, we need business .Our calculations are based on the guidance provided in the Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry (American Petroleum environments with the right conditions, including Institute) and the Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions (International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association). ExxonMobil invests in long term scientific research that benefits the economy and the environment. The cogeneration plant at ExxonMobil s refinery in Antwerp, Belgium, reduces CO2 emissions by nearly 200,000 metric tons annually. our polymer manufacturing facility in Cologne, Germany, a local team inspected the plant’s steam system to identify areas for potential savings. System improvements reduced steam consumption by 90 tons per month, a 20 percent reduction. At many of our sites, recovering waste heat to generate needed steam provides heat to processes that would otherwise require the combustion of additional fuel. ExxonMobil’s Global Real Estate and Facilities Group has been working on an initiative to reduce the environmental footprint of our offices. In 2012, we continued construction of our new 155-hectare campus just north of Houston, Texas. We carefully considered energy conservation during the design phase of the campus. By optimizing daylight availability and incorporating other energy efficiency measures, we expect to reduce our energy demand in the office buildings by more than 40 percent compared with traditional office buildings. ExxonMobil will install systems to monitor energy consumption to ensure campus buildings achieve a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star rating. In Calgary, Alberta, we are working with the developer of the new Imperial Oil campus to incorporate sustainable design practices into the construction process, buildings and associated green spaces. The use of high-efficiency heating and cooling systems, and lighting and motion sensors will make the campus 40 to 50 percent more efficient than our existing office buildings. In addition, we plan to launch energy conservation, waste minimization and recycling programs when this campus becomes Electricity from Steam from boilers remote power plant Refinery with Cogeneration Heat recovery steam generator operational. The new Aviation Lubricants Blending & Packaging Plant in Port Allen, Louisiana, will also have a sustainability focus that extends to the design, construction and operational phases. Cogeneration ExxonMobil is developing innovative ways to generate power more efficiently and with less environmental impact compared with purchasing electricity from a local utility. Cogeneration captures heat generated from the production of electricity for use in production, refining and chemical processing operations. ExxonMobil has interests in approximately 5,200 megawatts of cogeneration capacity in more than 100 individual installations  at more than 30 locations around the world. This capacity is equivalent to the electricity needs of approximately 2.5 million U.S. homes. In 2012, we added 220 megawatts of additional capacity from our new cogeneration facility in Singapore. We have additional  projects approved, which will add more than 300 megawatts by 2015, and several other projects are in various stages of development. Since 2004, we have invested more than $1 billion in cogeneration projects. Cutting-Edge Technology ExxonMobil invests in new technologies with transformative potential to increase energy supplies, reduce emissions and improve operational efficiency. Our research efforts involve proprietary in-house research and collaborations with other businesses, as well as research partnerships with universities — such as the Global Climate and Energy Project at Stanford University. This pioneering research program focuses on identifying breakthrough energy technologies ranging from solar fuels to CO2 storage. At our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical research facilities, we have spent nearly $9 billion on research and development over the past decade, including on technologies specifically related to reducing emissions. Our research portfolio includes a wide range of promising technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, biomass conversion and algae-based biofuels. We continuously monitor the competitive environment for game-changing opportunities. Carbon capture and storage After years of research, evaluation and practice, we have concluded that carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technically feasible way to reduce the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. CCS involves capturing, transporting and storing CO2 in underground geologic formations such as saline reservoirs, depleted oil or gas reservoirs, or deep coal beds. In the future, CCS technologies Greenhouse Gas Reductions from ExxonMobil Actions2 Net equity, CO2-equivalent emissions (millions of metric tons) Energy efficiency and cogeneration Flarereduction Year 2009 2.1 2010 4.8 2011 6.6 2012 8.4 2Cumulative since 2009 can offer other approaches to help reduce CO2 emissions, with the greatest opportunity in the coal- and gas-fired power sector. CCS economics can be improved when the CO2 is applied to enhanced oil and gas recovery in some amenable locations. However, CCS application will likely be limited until improved technologies are developed and countries adopt effective legal and regulatory frameworks to manage its use and potential impacts over time. Through our natural gas operations in Wyoming and our equity interest in the Sleipner field in Norway, among other projects, we captured approximately 4.5 million metric tons of CO2 for underground injection in 2012, bringing the total to more than 21 million metric tons since 1996. We also have a 25-percent interest in a CCS plant in Australia, associated with the Gorgon development project that will be the largest saline reservoir CO2 injection facility in the world, once operational. 4.5million metric tons of CO2 captured for underground injection in 2012 For the past year, ExxonMobil’s Controlled Freeze Zone™ (CFZ™) commercial demonstration unit in Wyoming has been separating CO2 from natural gas in a stream that could be efficiently re-injected for geo-sequestration or enhanced oil recovery. Cost advantages provided by the proprietary CFZ™ technology could expand the global supply of natural gas and contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. Algae ExxonMobil’s algae biofuels program was announced in 2009. In the early stages of this research effort, we remain focused on understanding the fundamental science of algae growth and harvesting necessary to produce algae-based biofuels. However, there are significant technological hurdles to developing economically competitive fuel from algae. We expect that commercialization, if eventually successful, would take a decade or more. Improving product performance ExxonMobil develops products that reduce energy use and emissions throughout our customers’ activities and supply chains, including Mobil Delvac 1™ LE 5W-30 — a fully synthetic, heavy-duty diesel engine oil that combines advanced engine protection with enhanced fuel economy potential; Mobil 1™ Advanced Fuel Economy — a high-performance synthetic engine oil that can help improve fuel economy by up to 2 percent; and Mobil DTE 10 Excel™ — a series of hydraulic oils that increases equipment output, resulting in potential for reduced energy consumption and operating costs. For information on how we are improving energy efficiency with our chemical products, see page 34. Public Policy Debate Public policy will play a key role in reducing GHG emissions in the future. The long-term objective of a climate change policy should be to reduce the risks posed by climate change while considering the importance of energy to global economic development. Any policy response aimed at mitigating global CO2 emissions will require participation from both developed countries and the major developing economies. Policymakers have available a range of strategies to reduce GHG emissions, including cap-and.trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Where regulated emissions trading schemes exist, ExxonMobil has traded allowances, when cost-effective, and will continue to do so in the future. For example, we have been active participants in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and recent California cap-and-trade programs. However, we believe a well-designed, revenue-neutral carbon tax mechanism provides a more cost-effective alternative to a cap-and-trade regime for reducing GHG emissions. International agreements and other regional and national regulations for GHG emissions reduction are still evolving, making it difficult to predict potential business impacts. We test a range of potential cost scenarios for energy-related GHG emissions in our Outlook for Energy. These forecasts use a cost of CO2 emissions to represent future climate policy options. Over time, ExxonMobil anticipates OECD3 member states’ CO2 costs to rise to about $80 per ton by 2040, with many non-OECD nations approaching $20 per ton. We use these forecasts as part of our financial analysis for major investment evaluations. Global engagement on climate change ExxonMobil scientists have undertaken climate change research and related policy analysis for nearly 30 years. Their work has resulted in the publication of more than 45 papers in peer-reviewed literature. In addition, two of our scientists are among only a few from our industry who have participated as authors in assessments of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change since its inception. We will continue to participate actively and constructively in advancing the state of climate science. For more information on the Corporation’s approach to managing climate change risks, see our Carbon Disclosure Project submittal at cdproject.net. 3Refer to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) website — oecd.org — for a  listing of its members. Stakeholder Engagement:        Partnering for GHG Reductions In a unique partnership, and after nearly 1 million man-hours of construction work, ExxonMobil and Air Products inaugurated a new world-scale hydrogen production plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. From the early planning phase through detailed engineering and startup of the facilities, ExxonMobil and Air Products worked closely together to maximize synergies and environmental benefits. The new plant connects to the extensive Rotterdam hydrogen pipeline network, which supplies hydrogen to several other customers in the region. The Air Products plant uses ExxonMobil’s excess refinery gas to produce hydrogen, and the refinery uses the hydrogen to manufacture petrochemicals and in refinery processes. The new hydrogen plant uses the most advanced processes and technologies, making it much more efficient than its predecessor. The hydrogen plant also delivers steam out of surplus heat to the refinery, replacing steam produced in traditional boilers. The synergy in the production processes of the two plants improves overall energy efficiency by more than 15 percent and reduces related CO. emissions by 200,000 metric tons per year, comparable to taking 90,000 cars off the road annually. “We need plants like this one nationally as well as internationally to achieve our European mid-term and long-term environmental ambitions. Air Products and ExxonMobil show that by a targeted investment and integration of industrial processes, a substantial energy saving and CO2 reduction are being achieved.” — Joop Atsma, State Secretary for Infrastructure and the  Environment, the Netherlands ExxonMobil Chemical’s product packaging solutions work to extend the shelf life of food products and provide lighter-weight packaging options. These innovations help reduce food waste and reduce transportation-related energy use. Around the world, approximately 870 million people — one in eight — suffer from hunger and malnutrition, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). At the same time, a 2011 FAO-commissioned study reports that roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tons — is lost or wasted. Improving the food supply chain to reduce food loss and waste is critical to ensuring that more people have enough food to live healthy and productive lives. While this issue is large and involves multiple factors, one lever is as simple as the way we package food. ExxonMobil Chemical’s products are helping to provide packaging solutions that address the challenges that exist in the food supply chain. The end goal is less waste and increased food availability. From bread bags to milk containers, packaging made from ExxonMobil Chemical’s high-performance products, such as Exceed™ and Enable™ metallocene polyethylene, can help extend freshness, deter spoilage and reduce food waste. Plastic film can extend a cucumber’s shelf life to 14 days. Increased Shelf Life Food often spoils due to improper or suboptimal storage. According to a 2013 Institution of Mechanical Engineers study, vast quantities of foodstuffs, estimated at between 30 percent and 50 percent of total global production, are lost or wasted between the field and consumer. Packaging has an important role to play in the reduction of these numbers. Plastic packaging solutions that ExxonMobil Chemical has developed can help preserve freshness and protect products, from farms to grocery shelves to kitchen tables. A cucumber, for example, which is 96 percent water, begins to dehydrate as soon as it is picked. After three days, it has lost so much water that it becomes dull, limp and unsellable. Wrapping it in just 1.5 grams of plastic film, however, can extend its shelf life to 14 days.. Lightweight Plastic Packaging ExxonMobil Chemical’s  products may also enable lighter-weight packaging solutions. According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), reduced packaging weight has the potential to benefit the entire value chain by reducing shipping costs, energy consumption, emissions and waste. The ACC notes that plastic jars can use up to 90 percent less material by weight than their glass counterparts, and lightweight, flexible packaging made from plastic or plastic-and-foil composites can use up to 80 percent less material than traditional bag-in-box packages. According to another ACC study of plastics used in packaging, a lightweight plastic tuna pouch can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 77 percent during transportation compared with a steel can. Compared with other types of polyethylene, ExxonMobil’s metallocene-based polyethylene products have enabled customers to make thinner films, while also improving the ease of film processing. Our advanced metallocene polyolefin resins, including Exceed™ and Enable™, can help consumer product companies reduce the amount of film used in packaging. For instance, the amount of film used in packaging applications such as bottled water and soda; bread and produce bags; frozen food bags; and prepared fish, meats and cheeses can be reduced by up to 30 percent over non-metallocene polyethylene grades. At the same time, these advanced polyolefins maintain or improve the properties of the finished film while enhancing overall packaging strength and durability. .Source: Cucumber Growers Association

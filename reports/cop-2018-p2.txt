In its 2018 World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency (IEA) illustrated a range of di.erent energy mixscenarios in 2040. Total energy demand increases in IEA’s Current Policies and New Policies scenarios, but remainsrelatively stable compared to 2016 in the 2-degree Celsius Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). Demand fornatural gas and oil have di.erent outcomes across the IEA scenarios. Oil demand grows relative to 2016 in theCurrent and New Policies scenarios but declines in SDS. In contrast, natural gas demand increases by year 2040across all the IEA scenarios.  Achieving the IEA’s 2-degree Celsius scenario requires signi.cant progress on several fronts: Improving energy e.ciency of power generation, transportation and industrial processes. Reducing emissions from fossil fuels or capturing and storing or utilizing those emissions.Central Tank Battery, Bakken, North Dakota.Impact on Business and StrategyClimate-related risks have the potential to impact our business in several ways. Our SD risk management processes identify those risks and assess the potential size, scope and prioritization of each. We have aligned a description of these impacts with the recommendations of the TCFD.Products andServicesCompliance with policy changes that create a GHG tax, emissions trading scheme or GHG reductions couldsigni.cantly increase product costs for consumers and reduce demand for natural gas- and oil-derived products. Demand could also be eroded by conservation plans and e.orts undertaken in response to global climate-related risk, including plans developed in connection with the Paris Agreement. Many governments also provide, or may in the future provide, tax advantages and other subsidies to support the use and development of alternative energy technologies that could impact demand for our products. However, there are also opportunities associated with increased demand for lower-carbon energy sources such as natural gas.Our scenario analysis indicates that as the energy sector transitions, it will be important to be competitive on both cost of supply and carbon. We have adjusted our portfolio to concentrate on lower-cost production and have divested some of our higher-emissions-intensity natural gas and oil sands .elds. We have also set a GHG emissions-intensity-reduction target for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.Supply Chain and/or Value ChainWe engage with suppliers on the environmental and social aspects of their operations and supply chains through each step of the procurement process, from supplier prequali.cation through supplier performance evaluation. This includes communicating our expectations and priorities and identifying opportunities for improvement and collaboration related to climate issues, including energy use, GHG management and environmental supply chain risks. We also engage through membership in several trade associations, such as IPIECA, that address climate-relatedFinancial PlanningWe take climate-related issues intoaccount in our .nancial planning inseveral ways. In the short to mediumterm, we use a range of commodityprices derived from our corporatescenario work. In the long term ourfour climate-related risk scenariosprovide insight into the possibilitiesfor future supply, demand and priceof key commodities. This helps usunderstand a range of risk aroundcommodity prices, and the potentialprice risk associated with variousGHG reduction scenarios. HistoryKebabangan platform, Malaysiahas shown an interdependencybetween commodity prices andoperating and capital costs. In the past, lower commodity prices have driven down operating and capital costs, whereas the opposite has been true when commodity prices have risen. We have aligned a description of the potential impacts on .nancial planning with the recommendations of the TCFD.  Operating Costs and RevenuesWe recognize the potential impact on our costs, demand for fossil fuels, the cost and availability of capital and exposure to litigation caused by new or changing climate-related policy. The long-term impact on our .nancial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on several factors:Extent and timing of policy.Implementation detail such as cap-and-trade or an emissions tax system.GHG reductions required.Level of carbon price.Price and availability of o.sets.Amount and allocation of allowances.Technological and scienti.c developments leading to new products or services.and the U.K. We are one of 59 companies participating in The Environmental Partnership in the U.S., a coalition ofnatural gas and oil companies working to improve methane emissions management. As part of our commitment,our U.S. Lower 48 operations have focused on two key areas:Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) programs — We conducted more than 4,300 site surveys across our assets to detect leaks and quickly repair them. While this is a regulatory requirement in many areas, over 60% were done voluntarily. These surveys continue to provide a better understanding of where leaks occur and what we can do to minimize fugitive emissions.Pneumatic device evaluation and conversion — All high-bleed pneumatic controllers have been removed or replaced and we are focused on green.eld designs to reduce pneumatic emissions at new facilities. We have a complete inventory of pneumatic devices and continue to evaluate solutions to reduce emissions.Other reduction projects in the U.S. include:  Our Lower 48 business unit is coordinating with our corporate technology team to test the e.ectiveness ofdrone technology for detecting methane leaks from our operations. A pilot project was initiated in the Eagle Fordin late 2018.In the Bakken, natural gas from production must be less than a speci.ed temperature to be eligible to go into themidstream pipeline; if it is not it may be .ared. By having gas chillers available, we can get more gas and reduce.aring.In Canada, GHG reduction projects include:The use of non-condensable gas in the oil sands. Read more here. Carbon XPRIZE.

Seven of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) member companies, led by ConocoPhillips Canada, partnered with NRG Energy, a leading U.S. integrated power company, to back the global competition. The competition began in 2015 with 47 entries from seven countries. Winning teams will be announced in 2020.The prize challenges the world to reimagine what can be done with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by incentivizing and accelerating the development of technologies that convert CO2 from fossil fuel combustion into valuable products. Finalist teams range from entrepreneurs and start-ups to academic institutions and companies that have been tackling the carbon challenge for more than a decade. These teams are working on transforming carbon from emissions into things people will use, such as enhanced concrete, liquid fuels, plastics and carbon fiber.“It’s really exciting to be able to provide the opportunity for these teams to develop CO2 conversion technologies in the lab, but more importantly in real world conditions to prove they can be deployed at power plants and other industrial facilities such as ours,” said ConocoPhillips Canada Vice President for Development Khoa Dao.The competition has two tracks: one focused on testing technologies at a coal-fired power plant and one at a natural gas.fired power plant. The 10 finalists have received equal shares of a U.S. $5 million milestone prize to test their technologies at commercial scale under real-world conditions at the Integrated Test Center in Gillette, Wyoming for the coal track or at the Alberta Carbon Conversion Technology Centre in Calgary for the natural gas track.Teams will be scored on how much CO2 they convert and the net value of their products. Ultimately, each of the two winning teams in the natural gas and coal tracks will be awarded a U.S. $7.5 million grand prize in the spring of 2020.IN THIS SECTIONWaterAssessing water risks is part of our risk management process.Assessing RisksLEARN MOREAddressing priority risks.Risk Register & Action PlanLEARN MOREWater use depends on unique local conditions.Water ManagementLEARN MOREFinding innovative solutions.Integrating TechnologyLEARN MOREIN THIS SECTIONWaterAssessing water risks is part of our risk management process.Assessing RisksLEARN MOREAddressing priority risks.Risk Register & Action PlanLEARN MOREWater use depends on unique local conditions.Water ManagementLEARN MOREFinding innovative solutions.Integrating TechnologyLEARN MOREIN THIS SECTIONWaterAssessing water risks is part of our risk management process.Assessing RisksLEARN MOREAddressing priority risks.Risk Register & Action PlanLEARN MOREWater use depends on unique local conditions.Water ManagementLEARN MOREFinding innovative solutions.Integrating TechnologyLEARN MOREIN THIS SECTIONWaterAssessing water risks is part of our risk management process.Assessing RisksLEARN MOREAddressing priority risks.Risk Register & Action PlanLEARN MOREWater use depends on unique local conditions.Water ManagementLEARN MOREFinding innovative solutions.Integrating TechnologyLEARN MOREWater Recycling in the Delaware BasinProduced water disposal optionsLocal water availability LogisticsEconomicsRegulationsThe majority of water required for completions is transported using temporary, lay-.at pipelines and in-groundpipelines, rather than trucks. We have also continued to increase the percentage of produced water transported bypipeline rather than trucks. In the Delaware and Montney basins, all produced water is transported by pipeline. Inthe Bakken, most of the produced water is now transported via pipeline. The new Eagle Ford central gathering anddistribution pipeline system for new wells in DeWitt County is expected to be completed by year-end 2019,facilitating produced water transfer via pipeline.Protecting Local Water ResourcesProtection of local groundwater resources is important during every stage of development and production. OurGlobal Onshore Well Management Principles incorporate established industry best practices and internal standards.These principles demand diligent focus on every activity, from community consultation about exploration to .nalsite restoration, and provide direction on design, construction, .uid management and monitoring during drillingand hydraulic fracturing. Our principles, together with our Onshore Well Integrity practices, guide how we protectand respect people and the environment as we focus on:Safeguarding workers and communities.Minimizing risks of leaks and spills.Protecting groundwater and surface water.To protect groundwater, we adhere to safe water management practices as outlined in our Guideline forGroundwater Baseline Assessment and Monitoring, which includes guidance on when and how baseline samplingshould be conducted. Our risk-based approach provides the appropriate level of assessment, analysis andmonitoring using scienti.cally sound methods. While many areas of our operations already conduct state-regulatedor voluntary baseline groundwater assessments, the guideline de.nes how this practice should be applied in areasnot already covered. Baseline testing helps assess groundwater quality and protects the interests of stakeholderswhen conducted properly.Induced SeismicityOur risk-based Global Induced Seismicity Guideline is linked to established standards to better manage risks relatedto the planning and operation of our new injection wells and for screening third-party injection operations ifcircumstances warrant. The guideline helps characterize seismicity risks by assessing historical seismicity, identifying

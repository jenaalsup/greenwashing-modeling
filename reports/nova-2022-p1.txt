INTRODUCTION / OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT We define material sustainability issues1 as those that impact our business and our stakeholders. In our most recent materiality assessment conducted in 2021, we engaged key stakeholders and identified “Tier One Priority Topics” that have the greatest impact on both our business and society. These topics informed our goals and our 2022 ESG strategy, and they continue to inform key business decisions. Read more on Materiality CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES In 2022, we focused our efforts to deepen our understanding of a material topic that consistently ranks highly across our stakeholders—climate risks and opportunities. In our effort to drive alignment with the TCFD recommendations, we engaged a climate specialist to assess Sunnova’s material climate-related risks and opportunities and their associated financial impacts through a climate scenario analysis. From this analysis, we are developing strategies to mitigate relevant risks and pursue further opportunities for our business. Read our Climate Scenario Analysis LEADING FRAMEWORKS We align our strategy and reporting with leading frameworks and standards to drive alignment in sustainability communications. Our sustainability strategy is informed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

MESSAGE FROM THE CEO Overall, 2014 was a year of strong execution and operating results for our company, and marked the completion of our transformation into an exploration and production company. While our industry continues to be challenged by the sharp decline in oil prices that began late last year, Hess is well positioned to manage through the current environment while preserving our long term growth options. We have a strong balance sheet, a focused portfolio of world class assets and top quartile operating capabilities. Our company is steadfastly committed to being a trusted energy partner that helps meet the world’s growing energy needs in a safe, environmentally responsible, socially sensitive and profitable way. Fundamental to that commitment are the Hess Values of Integrity, People, Performance, Value Creation, Social Responsibility and Independent Spirit. Through our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we translate these Values into sustainable practices that guide the way we do business. In 2014 we advanced several key initiatives aimed at driving long term sustainable performance: enhancing global standards, improving our environment, health, safety and social responsibility strategy, and applying “lean” principles across our operations to create additional value and eliminate waste. As we strive for continuous improvement in safety performance, our ultimate goal is to reach zero safety incidents – a goal that is shared at every level throughout our company. In 2014 we made significant progress in safety performance. Our combined employee and contractor Total Recordable Incident Rate decreased by 23 percent, and our Lost Time Incident Rate was down by 14 percent compared with previous year performance. To align safety and health systems for our contractors, who make up more than 80 percent of our workforce, with our internal expectations, we utilize safety prequalification systems and supplier assessments. Process safety is another critical focus area for the company in order to prevent unintentional releases that could result in a major incident. Throughout the year, we took significant steps to strengthen the three key strategic elements of our process safety program: enhancing process safety leadership; understanding and addressing process safety vulnerabilities; and educating people across the organization in process safety awareness. At Hess we strive to make a positive impact on the communities where we do business. Corporate social responsibility enhances our ability to be an effective, profitable and trusted energy partner and is a way of doing business for Hess. We integrate social considerations into our business planning using a three-faceted approach that brings together stakeholder engagement, social risk and impact management, and strategic social investment while minimizing the social and environmental impacts from operations. Our corporate social responsibility governance framework includes commitments to international voluntary initiatives that are designed to protect the environment, promote human rights and encourage financial transparency. In 2014 we continued with our endorsement of commitments to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Global Compact, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Hess’ strategic social investments are aimed at creating shared value that improves the quality of life in local communities and helps create a favorable operating environment. Our social investment program in 2014 totaled $42 million, with about $34 million directed toward education projects. The balance is directed primarily to economic development, health and capacity building. To meet the world’s energy needs, all forms of energy are needed, with fossil fuels continuing to make up the majority of supply for the foreseeable future. The International Energy Agency’s most recent forecast projects energy demand to increase 37 percent by 2040, with fossil fuels comprising 74 percent of the energy mix. Therefore, it is more important than ever for cooperation between world leaders and industry to develop comprehensive energy and climate solutions. We acknowledge the need for transparent and equitable carbon price signals that will promote energy efficiency and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Our focus is on cost effective climate change policy responses that balance mitigation, adaptation and societal priorities. We manage climate change risks, along with many other business risks, through our enterprise risk management process. Between 2008 and 2014, we have reduced net “We are proud of our progress in 2014 and conﬁdent  in our ability to build a sustainable enterprise that makes a positive difference for our stakeholders and the  world around us.” John B. Hess, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer equity greenhouse gas emissions from our oil and gas operations by 40 percent, or over 4 million tonnes of absolute emissions, through a combination of improved operating processes, asset sales and refinery closures. In the United States, oil and gas from shale has become a critically important source of supply. The shale revolution has put the U.S. on a path to energy independence, buoyed national and state economies, bolstered tax revenues for federal, state, and local governments, and helped bring down energy related carbon dioxide emissions as natural gas has replaced coal in electricity generation. As an industry, we need to do a better job of educating the public about energy’s value as a natural resource, its importance to our economy, and the practices that are in place to ensure that we are operating in a safe and environmentally and socially responsible manner. Hess, as one of the largest producers in the Bakken play in North Dakota and as an emerging producer in the Utica wet gas play in Ohio, is committed to responsible shale energy development. We have a flaring reduction strategy in place and have been steadily investing in supporting infrastructure, and we have onsite operating practices to prevent potential surface water and groundwater impacts. We also have ongoing efforts to reduce or eliminate the use of chemical additives in fracturing fluids, and require our hydraulic fracturing contractors to make nonproprietary data publicly available on the FracFocus website regarding the chemicals used in each fractured well. Improving the safe transport of crude oil by rail is a growing concern to be addressed through a shared effort among railroad operators, regulators and producers. At Hess, we are committed to doing our part to minimize the risks involved through our own practices and as part of oil and gas industry efforts. All of our assets undergo multidisciplinary risk assessments to identify mitigation measures we can pursue to help protect the environment, the communities in which we operate and the safety of our workforce. We provide extensive information on our programs and performance through our annual corporate sustainability report and on our company website at hess.com. Our strong operating results in 2014 are a tribute to our high-quality workforce and a company culture that fosters performance, professional growth and teamwork. The divestiture of multiple businesses affected a significant number of employees in 2014. In keeping with our Values, Hess provided comprehensive support to ease the transition for those impacted, including an enhanced severance program. Looking ahead, we will continue our focus on talent management, employee engagement, learning and development and diversity and inclusion, with the recognition that our employees hold the key to our company’s continued success. Our 2014 Corporate Sustainability report shows how sustainable business practices are integrated into our short term goals and long term strategy, particularly in managing the key challenges and opportunities with economic, environmental and social performance. We are proud of our progress in 2014 and confident in our ability to build a sustainable enterprise that makes a positive difference for our stakeholders and the world around us. We are thankful for the ongoing support and partnership of our employees, communities, customers, suppliers, business partners and investors today and in the future. Chief Executive Officer ABOUT HESS Hess Corporation is a leading global independent energy company engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. 2014 HIGHLIGHTS • Averaged 83,000 barrels of oil Hess Portfolio of Operations equivalent per day (BOEPD) net production from the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota, a 24 percent increase over 2013 • In March 2014, commenced operation of our expanded Tioga, North Dakota, gas plant • Achieved first production at the Hess operated Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf  of Mexico in November 2014 • In the Utica shale in Ohio, brought 39 wells into operation, increasing wet gas production to 13,000 BOEPD in the fourth quarter of 2014 Exploration • In the North Malay Basin, averaged 40  Developments  Production million cubic feet of gas per day net production in 2014, a 33 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2013 Our key exploration locations are the Gulf of Mexico, Exploration • Completed a three well appraisal Ghana, Guyana and Nova Scotia. program on the Deepwater Tano Cape Developments are underway at several assets, including Three Points block, offshore Ghana Stampede in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as staged Developments developments at the Malaysia/Thailand Joint ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS Development Area and the Hess operated North Malay In 2014 our direct economic Basin project in the Gulf of Thailand. contributions included payments to suppliers, capital and exploration Production operations are ongoing globally.

The growth in energy demand will come from emerging market countries trying to advance their standards of living and meet societal priorities. Demand in developed countries will remain flat. Meeting this long term demand will require all types of energy, including fossil fuels and renewables. As a company, our mission is to meet society’s energy requirements in an environmentally and socially responsible, safe and profitable way. Our success as a company depends upon fully integrating both technical and non-technical risks into our lean philosophy and daily operating rhythm and then exhibiting outstanding execution. The purpose of this page is to provide a snapshot of our progress and path forward with respect to our most material environment, social and governance (ESG) programs and initiatives. In-depth discussion of these topics can be found throughout this report. Issue  Progress  Path Forward  How We Operate  Operating in a challenging environment (low oil prices/ excess supply) Protecting our license to operate and enhancing our reputation  Continued to implement lean principles to eliminate waste and drive continuous improvement Maintained focus on enterprise risk management as an integral part of operational excellence Began rollout of enhanced global standards to formalize enterprise wide expectations and responsibilities Began updating our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) strategy Increased scope of ESG disclosures  Deploy lean metrics Continue to embed enterpise risk management process into business functions Roll out and implement complete set of enhanced global standards Complete EHS & SR strategy refresh and establish metrics to gauge performance Expand reporting to meet growing stakeholder expectations  Community and Social Performance  Enhancing our reputation as a trusted energy partner  Reviewed social, political and economic environments for existing and proposed areas of operation to identify non-technical risks and mitigation activities and to integrate them into our strategic planning Developed a standard enterprise wide stakeholder engagement process and set of tools  Continue to integrate stakeholder engagement, social risk and impact management and social investment into enterprise business processes Expand grievance mechanisms across the enterprise  Safety and Health  Focusing on continuous improvement as we aspire toward zero incidents  Focused on enhancing personal and process safety leadership, identifying vulnerabilities and educating employees Incorporated EHS reviews into the procurement process Procured more than 500 railcars with enhanced safety performance features  Continue to enhance enterprise wide contractor prequaliﬁcation and selection process Remain actively engaged with multi-stakeholder rail safety task forces  Our People  Managing major structural changes in our organization as part of a multi-year transformation to an exploration and production company  Effectively managed the divestiture of the downstream businesses, which resulted in a signiﬁcantly smaller employee workforce Renewed focus on key human resources programs  Progress initiatives in key programs, including employee engagement, onboarding, talent management, diversity and inclusion, process efﬁciency, reliability and data integrity  Climate Change, Energy and Environment  Responsibly managing our environmental footprint  Expanded carbon asset risk and methane reporting Continued to build infrastructure in North Dakota to transport associated gas to market and reduce ﬂaring Conducted environmental impact assessments for new or proposed projects  Work toward setting reasonable methane reduction targets through the ONE Future coalition Expand depth of carbon asset risk reporting Meet regulatory requirement to reduce North Dakota wellhead ﬂaring to 10 percent by 2020 Examine additional opportunities to reduce waste and environmental footprint  This report describes the company’s strategy and performance regarding significant economic, environmental and social issues in 2014. Financial and governance information, including our annual report, our U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K filing and our proxy statement, is available on our website. Additional sustainability and investor information is available at hess.com/investors REPORTING STANDARDS We annually report our sustainability performance based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3.1/Oil & Gas Sector Supplement guidelines, to an A+ application level. Our report is also based on the Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting developed by IPIECA, the American Petroleum Institute and the International Oil and Gas Producers Association, as well as on the 10 principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. A GRI Content Index, cross-referenced with IPIECA indicators and the UN Global Compact principles, is provided at the end of this report. An expanded GRI Index is available at hess.com/gri-index MATERIALITY Over the past several years we have strengthened our materiality assessment process. By engaging key stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, customers, communities, shareholders, governmental and non-governmental organizations, industry peers and academics, we are able to maintain and strengthen our license to operate. New and emerging issues that are important to these groups form the basis for the content of this sustainability report, consistent with the GRI G3.1 guidelines for determining materiality. In early 2015, we conducted a materiality assessment survey to validate our internal assessment and expand upon it to ensure that we incorporate stakeholder expectations into our materiality assessment. The results of our materiality assessment survey are presented on the next page. While we report on a broad range of GRI and IPIECA indicators, we consider the topics listed as our most material, in the order in which they are disclosed in this report. BOUNDARY SETTING The scope of this report includes principal facilities and assets operated by Hess Corporation and its subsidiaries during calendar year 2014, unless otherwise indicated. The majority of data presented are gross figures from operated facilities, unless specified otherwise. In 2014 Hess completed the divestiture of its downstream businesses. The Retail business was part of the Hess portfolio through the third quarter of 2014. Limited 2014 data for this business is provided separately on our website. See our expanded performance data at hess.com/sustainability/performance-data/ key-sustainability-metrics We report some quantitative environment, health and safety data on a normalized basis to facilitate year-on.year comparisons. We report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on both an operated and net equity share basis in accordance with the IPIECA Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting GHG Emissions (2nd edition, May 2011).

On an individual basis, divestitures did not meet the threshold for removing them from our 2008 GHG emissions baseline. This is discussed further in the Climate Change and Energy section of this report. Our social investment spend has also not been restated, since the downstream-focused investments were not material, representing a very small percentage of the overall expenditure (less than 5 percent). INTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE We have internal documentation and information systems in place to promote consistent and reliable data collection and aggregation from all of our Hess operated and joint venture assets. We conduct quality assurance/quality control reviews and validation to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of facility specific and aggregated data. Due to rounding, individual numbers in the charts, tables and text may not sum to the total amounts shown. The unit of currency used in this report is the U.S. dollar. EXTERNAL ASSURANCE ERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS) conducts annual third party assurance of our sustainability report, including consistent and objective data collection and the reporting of our sustainability performance. ERM CVS also reviews our self-declared GRI G3.1 Application Level. In previous years ERM CVS’ assurance related to the business at the time (including the Marketing and Refining business). As 2013 and earlier data have been restated in this year’s report to reflect the upstream business, it should be noted that this year’s assurance process included the 2014 data and that the restated numbers for prior years have not been assured. The Independent Assurance Statement is provided on page 57 of this report. In addition to providing assurance in relation to our sustainability report, ERM CVS also conducts a separate verification of the GHG emissions data provided in this report and in our CDP Climate Change response. 2014 KEY DEVELOPMENTS  2015 GOALS  > Further strengthened our Global Compliance Program  > Enhanced our contractor selection, management and review process  > Completed a non-technical risk assessment and an integrated risk register for both technical and non-technical risks for our North Dakota operations  > Roll out enhanced enterprise wide environment, health and safety standards on a prioritized basis  > Implement our updated Conflict of Interest Policy and our new Gifts, Meals, Entertainment, Hospitality and Travel Support Policy  > Complete risk assessments and develop integrated risk registers for all assets in the Hess portfolio  We seek to conduct business in a manner that meets the highest standards of corporate citizenship, creates a long lasting, positive impact on the communities where we do business and delivers long term value to our shareholders. Our goal to be a trusted energy partner and our six core Hess Values underpin our business philosophy. The Hess Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of Conduct), along with our policies covering corporate social responsibility, human rights, and environment, health and safety, build on our Values to define our internal expectations for sustainable management and performance. GOVERNANCE AND KEY INITIATIVES Hess’ governance structure ensures that the highest level of oversight rests with the Board of Directors while direct responsibility lies with the company’s senior leadership. In 2013 the Board of Directors established the Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Subcommittee of the Audit Committee. Each member of the Subcommittee is a member of the Audit Committee and is independent and qualified under standards established by applicable law, stock exchange listing standards and Hess’ Corporate Governance Guidelines. See Hess’ Corporate Governance Guidelines at hess.com/hessgovernanceguidelines The purpose of the EHS Subcommittee is to assist the Board with respect to identifying, evaluating and monitoring EHS risk and strategy that could affect the company’s business activities, performance and reputation, and developing recommendations to the Audit Committee and to the Board on policies, programs and practices to address such issues and risks. The members have extensive oil and gas industry experience, including operations, research and development, and financial expertise. The EHS Subcommittee met four times in 2014. Hess is governed by the Hess Leadership Team (HLT), which is chaired by our CEO and comprises the company’s most senior executives. The HLT focuses on operational, strategic and financial issues and is the highest approval body before the Board of Directors. The HLT meets face to face at least every other month. An operational subcommittee of the HLT, which is chaired by our President and COO, meets weekly and focuses on operational matters. Environmental and social issues and performance are discussed at these meetings. In 2013 Hess formed the Operational Excellence Council (OEC), composed of several senior vice presidents and others, which recommends and governs enterprise wide, high impact initiatives that encompass multiple disciplines. The OEC’s purpose is to ensure alignment and integration, prioritize initiatives, load-level and implement initiatives HOW WE OPERATE consistently, hold initiative leaders accountable for delivery and sustain improvement over time. Two key initiatives sponsored by the OEC with direct relevance to environmental and social issues include the environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) strategy refresh project and the global standards project. EHS & SR Strategy Refresh With our transformation to an exploration and production company complete, we have begun to refresh and update our climate change, environment, health, safety and social responsibility strategy to align with our goal of becoming a trusted energy partner. We believe that refreshing our enterprise wide EHS & SR strategy will contribute to improving operational effectiveness and management of stakeholder expectations, reducing risk and protecting our license to operate. We began working on our strategy refresh in the fall of 2014 by developing and implementing the governance structure for the project, including a Strategy Refresh Project Team and a Steering Committee, and conducting kickoff meetings. Operations, Enterprise Risk, Corporate Strategic Planning, EHS, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Government Affairs and Sustainability managers and professionals compose the project team, which will develop the elements of the new strategy. The Steering Committee, which includes vice presidents from each of the major disciplines, provides guidance, expertise and strategic direction to the project team. The HLT and the EHS Board Subcommittee periodically review and provide feedback to the Strategy Refresh Project Team and Steering Committee. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we reviewed all recent asset-specific risk assessments conducted as part of our enterprise risk management process. In the first quarter of 2015, we retained a third party consultant to conduct a survey of material issues for our industry with industry peers and other external stakeholders. Obtaining external views allowed us to validate and build on our internal assessments. We are currently completing the second step of our strategy refresh – the industry benchmarking – and will develop strategic positioning and strategy development recommendations during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. In the interim, we plan on retaining several elements of our five-year climate change strategy, which concluded in 2013. Please refer to the Climate Change and Energy section of this report for more detail. Global Standards Our management systems provide a framework for managing risk, ensuring operational excellence, tracking key performance metrics and maintaining regulatory compliance. Under the leadership of the OEC, we have been developing and implementing an enhanced framework of global standards as part of our management systems to formalize enterprise wide expectations and accountabilities and support a globally consistent approach to environment, health, safety and social risk management. A risk-based approach was adopted to prioritize the order of development and implementation for each of the standards. The first set of enhanced standards was developed by cross-asset and cross-functional development teams and approved by year end 2014, with the second set to follow in 2015. EHS & SR Strategy Refresh Timeline Conduct a materiality and risk assessment based on three views: 1) an internal review of asset.    specific risk assessments 2) survey results from industry    peers; and  3) survey results from external    stakeholders. Conduct an industry peer benchmark analysis on each of the issues determined to be most material for our industry.

Review with Hess leadership. Develop a detailed EHS & SR strategy. Identify metrics to measure performance. Review with Hess leadership. Following the development and approval of each set of standards, assets will complete gap assessments and develop plans to implement and embed each standard. As the enhanced standards are developed, approved and implemented, we will continue to check and adjust the process regularly to ensure their effective and sustainable implementation. KEY ENTERPRISE PROCESSES We rigorously apply a number of key processes in our organization that provide the foundation for managing risk and achieving operational excellence at Hess. We utilize these processes to evaluate investment opportunities and identify and mitigate risks in potential, new and existing operations. Enterprise Risk Management Effective risk management at Hess is at the core of our commitment to operational excellence. Our enterprise risk management (ERM) process applies a comprehensive, standardized approach to identifying and managing risks of all types across our operations. Information from subject matter experts and recent audits is used to develop a associated likelihood and potential impact to our business. “Critical” risks – risks with higher likelihood and impact or those that are unlikely but would have – are placed on an integrated risk register that catalogs actions for managing or mitigating each risk. In 2014 risk assessments were completed and risk registers were begun for all assets in the Hess portfolio. In 2015 the ERM group will continue to develop risk excellence standards and guidelines for all risk related functions. embedding this process into key business functions at Hess, including project planning and entry into new areas of operation. We are also in the early stages of integrating risk management with our stakeholder engagement program, which includes alignment of key contacts at the asset level and facilitation of stakeholder mapping at ERM workshops to enable effective stakeholder management. For more information about the stakeholder engagement program, see the Community and Social Performance section of this report. Value Assurance Value Assurance is an independent review process within Hess to ensure that investment opportunities and decisions are properly characterized and assessed. Major capital projects are screened at various stages to verify that environmental and socioeconomic concerns, regulatory requirements and other non-technical risks have been incorporated into early project design and planning. A major project follows a series of “stage gates,” which ensures that recommendations made to mitigate them, at each stage before the project transitions to the next stage. At the Frame Stage, for example, a decision to proceed is based on the risk and commercial feasibility and the economic viability of project alternatives. During the Screen Stage, risks, uncertainties preferred option meeting economic and Stage is marked by the completion of a Project Execution Plan and Risk Mitigation Plan, leading to project sanction. Value Assurance Process HOW WE OPERATE During the Implement Stage, the project must demonstrate operational readiness. The final stage is Operate; the project is handed over to the Operations Team and begins production operations. New Country Entry When evaluating opportunities in a new country of operation, we assess non.technical above ground risks associated with that location using the new country entry (NCE) process. This cross-functional process involves a detailed questionnaire through which Hess subject matter experts from across the business provide input on various risks – including social, environment, legal, external affairs, compliance, commercial and supply chain risks – associated with operating in a particular country. The review draws on available information from governmental sources such as the U.S. State Department and leading non-governmental organizations to categorize each risk as high, medium or low based on severity and whether the risk can be easily mitigated. The NCE process enhances the quality and breadth of information available to Hess leadership when evaluating new opportunities and enables the mitigation of identified risks by the project team once a commitment is made to enter a new country. The results of this process support our enterprise risk management and value assurance workflows, enabling us to use this information at key decision points in our investment and project planning processes. Beginning in 2013 this process was expanded from new projects to include an annual review of all significant existing assets, which allows for a recurring, formalized evaluation of risk in our ongoing activities. Lean Hess has adopted lean principles to drive continuous improvement and enable the company to provide value to communities, employees, business partners, shareholders and other stakeholders. To Hess, lean is not a tactical, a near term or a cost cutting program. Rather, it is a way of thinking and acting for an organization to create value, improve performance and eliminate waste. Lean begins with building a company culture of learning and execution. With a deep respect for people, our leaders engage employees to develop problem-solving skill sets, enabling employees to eliminate waste and solve problems they face every day. We are actively managing our value streams, creating standard work, identifying customer– supplier relationships, defining clear hand-offs, enabling smooth work flows and continuing to improve our standards. Our high-level strategy is cascaded to individual objectives. Our business plans Lean Principles Clear Dashboards Quality Business Plans focus on the key breakthroughs necessary to meet our short and long term goals. We track daily operational and breakthrough progress, make problems visible and structure operating meetings to efficiently address clearly defined issues. And we apply structured problem-solving using the scientific method, constantly striving for perfection. Lean was first deployed in Hess’ onshore unconventional assets, where field development depends on drilling, completing and producing from a large number of wells. Lean principles, tools and methodologies were initially applied in the Bakken in North Dakota, where Hess has drilled and completed more than 200 wells annually over the past several years. Since 2011 Hess has reduced drilling cycle time by more than 50 percent and drilling and completion costs by almost 50 percent while improving safety performance by more than 50 percent. Applying lessons learned in the Bakken, Hess has implemented lean in its Utica asset in Ohio. As this unconventional asset has completed its appraisal phase and moved into development, the team has Effective Structured Operating Problem Rhythm Solving Leadership Behavior and People Development reduced its drilling cycle time by almost 70 percent and drilling costs per foot by 40 percent. Offshore assets have also begun to apply lean principles to their operations. ETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT Our Code of Conduct describes the business conduct and behaviors that Hess expects of its employees, officers, directors and contractors. We expect that our suppliers, contractors, agents and other business partners will follow similar principles when working for Hess and our subsidiaries. The Code of Conduct has been translated for employees in each of our countries of operation outside the United States. The company takes disciplinary actions, including termination of employment or services, for violations of the Code of Conduct and related policies.  Our compliance policies and procedures all stem from the Code of Conduct. The Global Compliance Program establishes, maintains and enforces policies, procedures, processes and initiatives to prevent and detect compliance violations. Its aim is to promote an organizational culture that encourages commitment to ethical conduct and compliance with the law. To continuously improve compliance controls and embrace best practices, our Global Compliance organization focuses on internal investigations, anti-corruption and other enterprise programs. The  Chief Compliance Officer reports to the General Counsel and informs the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. In 2014 Hess globally implemented the Gifts, Meals, Entertainment, Hospitality and Travel Support Policy and the Conflicts of Interest Policy to provide employees with further guidance regarding what constitutes ethical business conduct. Additional noteworthy accomplishments included the rollout of a new online training program on these policies and the Code of Conduct, which was completed by 100 percent of employees throughout the year. In addition, enhanced investigative tracking and reporting mechanisms for employees were put in place to promote greater access and transparency. These initiatives are continuing into 2015. The Global Compliance group is further enhancing Hess’ Anti-Corruption Compliance Program through the implementation of an updated Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedure, the rollout of automated approval systems and the launch of online anti-corruption training. These global initiatives will occur in 2015 and  into 2016. POLITICAL SPENDING Under Hess policy, all colleagues (defined as full time, part time and contract employees) are prohibited from using Hess funds to contribute to a national, state or local political campaign, a political party, or election committee, or to pay a debt related to such activities. This prohibition includes both direct and indirect cash and in-kind contributions. In 2014 there were no political contributions made by Hess employees using corporate funds. In the United States, federal election law permits corporations to establish political action committees (PACs), which may make political contributions. In February 2014 the company formed the Hess PAC for eligible employee contributions. All contributions to the Hess PAC are voluntary and publicly disclosed to the U.S. Federal Election Commission (fec.gov). In 2014 the Hess PAC received $21,500 in contributions and did not make any disbursements. As legally permitted, Hess corporate funds, resources and facilities were used to provide administrative support for the Hess PAC. HOW WE OPERATE Hess belongs to a number of trade associations, primarily to give the company access to the business, technical and industry best practices expertise of these associations. Hess actively engages with various industry and trade groups (organized under the Internal Revenue Code) in the United States. In 2014 Hess contributed $250,000 to the Greater North Dakota Chamber for advocacy on issues that would preserve and promote a healthy, pro-business environment in the state. The advocacy included the Chamber’s campaign opposing the passage of general election ballot Measure 5. This measure sought to redirect 5 percent of North Dakota’s revenue from its oil extraction tax to a new, independent conservation fund not administered by the state, which Hess believes would have had a negative impact on the oil and gas producing business environment. The voters in North Dakota defeated the measure in November 2014 by a 60 percent margin. Except for funds contributed to the Greater North Dakota Chamber, no payments made by Hess to 501(c)(6) or 501(c)(4)organizations were used for express political advocacy. A list of memberships and associations that received more than $50,000 from Hess in 2014 can be found on page 58 of this report. We recognize that our positions do not always align with all formal positions of the associations, organizations and collaborative working groups in which we participate. Our funding should not be considered a direct endorsement of the entire range of activities undertaken by these membership organizations. To address concerns related to potential misalignment, we publish our positions on key sustainability issues in this annual sustainability report. SUPPLY CHAIN Our global reach extends well beyond our individual company operations to our business partners, suppliers and contractors. Maintaining a competitive and secure supply chain is one of the key ways we reduce our operational risk. In 2014 we purchased more than $8 billion of goods and services from more than 5,000 suppliers, and contractor manhours comprised more than 80 percent of our total workforce hours. Supplier Qualiﬁcations We employ a standardized approach to evaluate and measure the performance of potential and current suppliers on the basis of total value, including safety, quality, delivery and cost. We have a centralized system in place globally that houses all contract templates and other key materials and manages the contractor procurement process. We also use a central, global electronic sourcing system in a majority of our locations to collect bids and evaluate suppliers. This system allows for the efficient creation of online Requests for Proposals and encourages the use of best practices. Our contractor prequalification and selection process helps to ensure we are working with the most qualified companies. Where appropriate, potential contractors undergo a risk review, an anti-corruption and legal compliance review and a review of EHS programs and performance. Our procurement staff also reviews the potential contractors’ insurance, tax, legal and quality information; in case of discrepancies with our standards, the relevant department within Hess conducts an additional review. Contracts that involve higher risk, due either to the number of manhours the contractors will work at Hess or the nature of that work, automatically trigger an EHS review in the procurement process. As one part of the EHS review, we use recognized industry prequalification systems for most major areas of operations, including in the United States and Europe. This includes a review of training qualifications, safety programs and performance, an environmental checklist and proof of insurance. Potential contractors receive a rating based on this review. In cases where a contractor receives a rating that does not meet our requirements, an improvement plan should be in place before a contract with that supplier is established. Beginning in 2015, these formalized improvement plans are housed internally at the asset level using our existing EHS data system. Elsewhere, we use a standardized process with a questionnaire based on 14 safety and environmental elements. In our U.S. operations, the EHS review will also typically include an on-location audit. Supply Chain Transparency and Compliance Our suppliers of goods and services must comply with applicable laws and regulations in areas such as EHS, drug and alcohol use, conflicts of interest and anti-corruption laws, and must maintain any licensing or permitting requirements with respect to their activities. Contractors are also required to abide by our Code of Conduct. Standard contract clauses include requirements with respect to ethical business practices, human rights, social responsibility, business integrity, search and seizure and quality. In addition, clauses that cover federal contractor requirements are included for suppliers supporting our U.S. operations. Contracts typically also include a requirement that suppliers and contractors allow access to all offices and facilities and cooperate fully with all audits and inspections. Security Services Our Code of Conduct prohibits the use of local military or law enforcement personnel except where required by local authorities or in emergency situations. If the use of local military or law enforcement personnel is unavoidable, asset managers are requested to seek prior approval from Hess’ Legal Department and Global Security function. In operating locations where security services are necessary, we contract for these services locally with support from our Global Security and Global Supply Chain functions. Contracts with security services providers include clauses covering security and human rights expectations. These clauses detail our expectations for security providers to adhere to applicable international law enforcement principles, humanitarian law and human rights law. The clauses require our security contractors to communicate our human rights, social responsibility and ethical expectations to their employees and subcontractors, as well as demonstrate compliance. The aim is to ensure delivery of a consistent message of performance expectations for security contractors and drive consistency across Hess operations. These expectations are also detailed in our enterprise wide Security and Human Rights policy. We have also developed a Security and Human Rights Toolkit that can be used locally for training security personnel on human rights issues. In the event of a security incident with human rights implications, a report is made to the head of Global Security. Reports are also issued for those occurrences, such as peaceful community protests, that highlight potential future risk. We are not aware of any incidents where public or private security forces engaged community members in 2014, and no incident reports were filed. We are also piloting a formal mechanism to report such incidents internally using our existing data systems and plan to use this tool across the enterprise beginning in 2015. Local Content Internationally, we often prioritize local suppliers as part of production sharing contracts or other agreements with host countries. These agreements vary, but may include use of an approved vendor list, requirements for government approval of suppliers or threshold specifications for local companies or workers. We are also active participants in an industry partnership task force dedicated to developing and sharing best practices in this area. Supplier Engagement and Sustainability Hess continues to engage with suppliers on issues that are important to our industry and our stakeholders. Since 2009 we have worked with current and prospective suppliers of hydraulic fracturing services to define acceptable fracturing fluid systems, including restrictions on the selection and use of certain chemicals. We require suppliers to publish fracturing fluid chemical composition and quantities via the FracFocus website. While the majority of chemicals are identified by unique identification numbers issued by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and are listed on the publicly available CAS Registry, Hess allows its suppliers to use generic names for proprietary ingredients. 2014 KEY DEVELOPMENTS 2015 GOALS >  D raf ted > Developed a > Launched a > Invested more > Finalize and > Implement > Continue to > C onduct corporate social responsibility and human rights global standards  standard enterprise stakeholder engagement (SE) process and began rollout  stakeholder management database system to support SE and grievance mechanism  than $42 million in social programs throughout our portfolio  implement corporate social responsibility and human rights global standards  processes  At Hess, we view corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a way of doing business, enhancing our ability to be an effective, profitable and trusted energy partner. By proactively engaging with the communities where we operate, we can maximize our business value, manage social risks and impacts and create opportunities for stakeholders. We integrate social considerations into our business decisions using a three-pronged approach: stakeholder engagement, social risk and impact management, and strategic social investments that facilitate direct and indirect local benefits. Each element informs the others as we work toward continuous improvement. This approach fosters long term relationships, encourages operational success and supports profitable growth. GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK Our Hess Values and our Code of Conduct, which includes expectations regarding human rights, provide the starting point for our commitments to ethical and responsible business practices. Corporate Social Responsibility is one of the six Hess Values; it establishes our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship by protecting the health and safety of our employees, safeguarding the environment, and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. The next level of our CSR governance framework includes our commitments to international voluntary initiatives that Hess has endorsed or formally joined (collectively known as our “Voluntary Commitments”) and that are designed to protect the environment, promote human rights — including labor rights — and encourage financial transparency. In addition to our endorsement of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, our Voluntary Commitments include the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs), and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Hess serves on the board of the UNGC’s U.S. network. Our Corporate Social Responsibility, Human Rights, and Security and Human Rights policies all cascade from the umbrella of our Voluntary Commitments. This framework details our commitments to our employees and communities of operation through every phase of our business activity. It also sets expectations for employees and contracto In 2014 we drafted CSR and Human Rights Global Standards, which comprise the next le l CSR and Human Rights Global Standardsof our framework an cascade from our Toolkits, Training and Local Procedures/Plans policies.

As an international energy company, our access to resources depends on effective engagement with governments, regulators, communities and civil society. As such, it is critical for our company to understand the Governance Framework Hess Values and Code of Conduct Voluntary Commitments and Voluntary Principles Corporate Social Responsibility, Human Rights and Security, and Human Rights Policies expectations, priorities and concerns of our stakeholders, including communities, employees, suppliers, customers, industry members, governments and investors. We recognize that risks associated with our activities can have a significant impact on stakeholder relationships, public perception and the success of a project. In 2014 a multidisciplinary team developed a standard, enterprise wide stakeholder engagement process and set of tools. This process focuses on both the proactive relationship and trust building opportunities created by meaningful engagement, as well as the business value engagement brings when integrated as part of project risk management. Our stakeholder engagement process is consistent with the company’s “Plan, Do, Check, Adjust” continuous improvement methodology utilized by other Hess business processes such as lean, and thus adopts a disciplined methodology that also offers consistency across the enterprise. Stakeholder Engagement Process To operate effectively as guests in host communities requires a mutual understanding of expectations between Hess and those who live and work nearby. Indeed, stakeholder engagement is a critical aspect of operational success across the entire life cycle of our business, from the earliest phases of our new country entry process through the decommissioning of an asset. Proactive, ongoing stakeholder engagement helps set expectations, averting miscommunication and misunderstanding before they start. Stakeholder Engagement Process EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS We interact with many different types of external stakeholders, ranging from local landowners, leaseholders and communities to international  organizations. Our goal is to collaboratively identify opportunities benefiting our host communities, improve our business and strengthen our license to operate. Below are a few select examples of recent stakeholder engagement. Category  External Stakeholder Groups  Recent Examples of Engagement  Land Users/ Landowners  Residents, commercial land interests, farmers and ranchers  Bakken stakeholder engagement and grievance mechanism deployment to improve two-way dialogue and proactive risk management  Resources Users/ Rights Holders  Mineral rights owners, water rights owners and users, hunters/ﬁshers/gatherers  Proactive engagement in both Ghana and Kurdistan with community leaders and other stakeholders to better understand their interests and support our operations  Governments  Local, regional and national authorities, national military, international governing authorities  Hosted Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Ernest Moniz and Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) on a visit to Hess’ Bakken asset to educate them on North Dakota production and operations; served on DOE Secretary’s Advisory Board for the Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) and testiﬁed at DOE QER hearing in North Dakota on energy infrastructure challenges  Direct Economic Interests  Investment partners, vendors and suppliers, contractors, unions, shareholders  Hosted a Supplier Day meeting with representatives from Hess’ top 100 suppliers to initiate a supplier engagement process that will lower supply chain costs while continuing safe, reliable, efﬁcient operations  External Business Interests  Chambers of commerce, industry organizations, local businesses, sustainability initiatives  Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility serves on executive committee of IPIECA; leaders of Environment, Health and Safety and CSR functions actively participate in working groups and stakeholder engagement, including on such topics as biodiversity, social responsibility, water, climate change and sustainability reporting  Special Interest Groups  NGOs, religious groups, cause-oriented nonproﬁts, community groups  Active participant in multi-stakeholder initiatives, including the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, EITI and UNGC, to advance responsible business practices globally  Community Services  Local police/ﬁre/EMS, health care services, education, human service agencies  Conducted a training drill at Tioga Rail Terminal that included several agencies and organizations, including the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Ward County Emergency Management, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., Union Paciﬁc Co., and CHEMTREC.

Since 2009, we’ve successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, manufacturing yield and capacity utilization. In 2021, we produced 7.9 GWDC of solar modules, which represented an approximate 29% increase compared to 2020. The increase in production was primarily driven by the incremental Series 6 production capacity added in Malaysia in early 2021 and higher throughput at our manufacturing facilities. We expect to produce between 8.2 GWDC and 8.8 GWDC of Series 6 and Series 6 Plus modules during 2022. The increase in our production capacity and throughput, along with the incorporation of resource efficiency measures into new buildings and Series 6 tool designs and processes, helped significantly reduce our GHG emissions-, energy-, water-, and waste intensity in 2021. All First Solar manufacturing sites are certified to globally recognized standards: ISO 14001 for Environmental Management, ISO 9001 for Quality Management, and ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety. We foster a culture where environmental, health and safety (EHS) is an integral part of our associates’ work and require our contractors and suppliers to adhere to our standards and commitments. First Solar’s Environmental, Health and Safety Policy is available on our website. The policy is communicated to all associates through internal communication channels, associate meetings and notice boards throughout the facilities.We have received global recognition for our state-of-the art environmental controls, performance and manufacturing excellence. Our facilities in Perrysburg and Lake Township have received the Ohio EPA’s Encouraging Environmental Excellence Platinum Level Award in recognition of the company’s accomplishments in waste reduction, community engagement and eco-efficient manufacturing. In 2020, First Solar Malaysia received the prestigious State Environmental Excellence Award from the Kedah Department of Environment in recognition of our leadership and continuous efforts to demonstrate full environmental compliance in our manufacturing operations. First Solar’s Santa Clara office received the Green Business Program certification for efforts to ensure that our business operates in an environmentally friendly manner. First Solar had no environmental non-compliance cases in 2021.GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INTENSITY GOAL2008 Baseline246250200150100500Scope 1 + 2 Emissions Intensity

Since 2008, our company-wide carbon intensity decreased by approximately 70% as a result of increased module efficiency, manufacturing throughput and capacity utilization, along with energy conservation and low carbon initiatives. In 2021, our GHG emissions intensity decreased by 13% primarily due to the greater throughput and enhanced energy efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process. Our 2018-2020 emissions inventory was adjusted based on the latest market-based grid electricity emissions factor for Vietnam.We have set science-based targets to reduce our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 34% by 2028 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050, relative to 2020. We also aim to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 93% by 2028, from a 2008 baseline. These targets are in line with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We aim to achieve this by increasing our energy efficiency, going 100% renewable across our U.S. operations by 2026, enabling the offsite solar market in Malaysia and Vietnam, and purchasing bundled RECs and offsets as a last resort. In 2020, we joined RE100 and committed to powering our global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2028. We have installed onsite PV installations at our production sites in Ohio and Malaysia and at our recycling facility in Frankfurt Oder, Germany. We are now investigating opportunities to procure offsite solar electricity as part of our renewable energy strategy.21First Solar Sustainability Report 2022MANUFACTURING ENERGY INTENSITY 0.400.300.200.100.00kWh per Watt2009 Baseline0.340.252028 Target74% Reduction 0.090.160.130.122018201920202021In 2021, our manufacturing energy intensity (energy consumption per watt produced) decreased by approximately 8% compared to 2020 primarily due to the greater throughput and enhanced energy efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process. In 2021, we set a target to improve global energy efficiency per watt produced by 74% by 2028, from a 2009 baseline (or by 30% relative to 2020).First Solar’s manufacturing energy intensity includes all processes, from the beginning of our manufacturing process to finished module. Increased manufacturing throughput combined with module efficiency improvements and energy conservation initiatives have enabled us to cut our manufacturing energy intensity per watt by more than 65% since 2009.MANUFACTURING WATER INTENSITY2009 Baseline1.92.001.601.200.800.400.00Liters per Watt1.250.680.602028 Target87% Reduction 0.250.412019202020212018Since 2009, First Solar’s manufacturing water intensity (water consumption per watt produced) decreased by 78% due to significant improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, and the implementation of water conservation and recycling projects in our manufacturing and recycling operations. In 2021, First Solar’s manufacturing water intensity decreased by approximately 32% due to the increased throughput and efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as water recycling initiatives. In total, we saved more than 268 million liters of water in 2021, equivalent to approximately 8% of our absolute water use. Since 2018, all routinely operated First Solar recycling facilities in the U.S., Germany, Malaysia and Vietnam generate zero wastewater discharge under normal operations. Instead, the wastewater is recycled and converted into freshwater, which can then be reused in the recycling process.While our production increased by nearly 30% in 2021, our absolute water withdrawals decreased by approximately 7% due to the enhanced throughput and water efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as water recycling initiatives. We continue to review water consumption patterns down to the unit-operation level in our manufacturing process and are challenging our process engineers to deliver additional water savings. After surpassing our 71% water intensity reduction target seven years early, we set a new water intensity target of 0.25 liters per watt by 2028 or an 87% reduction compared to our 2009 baseline.We monitor and measure 100% of the water discharges from our manufacturing, recycling, and research and development facilities. In 2021, approximately 48% (or 1,629 megaliters) of First Solar’s total water withdrawn from water utilities (3,392 megaliters) was discharged as wastewater from our industrial wastewater treatment systems. Approximately 74% of our wastewater was sent to a third-party (municipal wastewater facility) and approximately 26% was discharged directly to fresh surface water (river). First Solar treats wastewater at our manufacturing and recycling facilities using a batch discharge system. Once treated, the water is collected in holding tanks, which are sampled and tested to confirm compliance with regulatory limits before being discharged. No industrial wastewater leaves our site unless we have tested and approved it for discharge, even if it is being discharged to a municipal wastewater treatment plant. If the water contaminant levels are above the permitted discharge limit, it is sent for re-treatment internally.Environmental Metrics and Targets24First Solar Sustainability Report 2022MANUFACTURING WASTE INTENSITY4035302520151050Grams per Watt2009 Baseline35.18.67.47.36.72018202020192021First Solar’s manufacturing waste generation intensity (grams per watt produced) has decreased by 81% since 2009 as a result of increased module and manufacturing efficiency combined with recycling and waste minimization projects.

Since 2012, we have reduced our hazardous waste generation per watt produced by 55%.Hazardous waste is classified according to the definition used by the countries in which we operate, e.g. under the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations in Malaysia, Law No. 55/2014/QH13 on Environmental Protection in Vietnam, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the U.S.MANUFACTURING WASTE RECYCLED VS.

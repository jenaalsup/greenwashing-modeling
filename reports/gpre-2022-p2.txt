Notably, we opened our Innovation Center at Omaha, the third such center across our platform. The Innovation Center at Omaha features a commercial-scale aquaculture feed mill, state-of.the-art laboratory space for aquaculture and Fluid Quip Technologies (FQT), and further lab space for potential future university partnerships. The facility also serves as a showroom for our company’s transformation and technologies. Alongside our existing Innovation Center at York, Nebraska and our Optimal Aqualab in Shenandoah, Iowa, the Innovation Center at Omaha rounds out our full suite of research, development and production capabilities. The Innovation Center at York features a pilot fermentation train as well as a world-class analytical lab, allowing for rapid testing of process yields. Additionally, the Innovation Center has downstream separation equipment used for on-site pilot development of FQT’s Clean Sugar Technology™ (CST™) and testing of process enhancements to the patented Maximized Stillage Co-Products™ (MSC™) protein recovery system. Being a leader in agricultural technology means investing in research and a devotion to identifying and scaling up the best available processes. These three innovation centers serve that crucial purpose for Green Plains. 2022 Technology Highlights: Breakthroughs in Sugar, Protein and Feedstock Ag-tech innovation is the catalyst of transformation at Green Plains, and it played a significant role in expanding our lower-carbon ingredient portfolio in 2022. We are leveraging patented technologies developed by our majority-owned subsidiary FQT to unlock more value from each kernel of corn while simultaneously lowering the carbon intensity (CI) of our ingredients across our operations. In this section, we highlight key technological innovations implemented last year that have significantly expanded our ability to offer new, lower-carbon alternatives for our customer partners in rapidly expanding markets. feedstock Any renewable, biological material that can be used directly as a fuel or converted to another form or fuel or energy product.4 4 Recent Advances in Thermochemical Conversion of Biomass, 2015 SOCIAL GOVERNANCE REPORTING FRAMEWORKS A New, Clean Sugar With Wide Applications Developed by FQT, CST™ can be used in dry-milling facilities such as those operated by Green Plains to produce dextrose and glucose rather than ethanol as their primary products. It is at the core of the build-out of our biocampus model, which will contribute to and support the emerging biorevolution. We are leveraging CST™ to add the production of low-carbon dextrose and glucose—the benefits of which are significant—to our biotechnology portfolio. As when producing ethanol, the process of making clean sugar also creates high-value co-products such as renewable corn oil and high-protein feed ingredients. Further, CST™ provides industrial quantities of carbohydrate feedstock that can be used in manufacturing applications in the growing biochemical, renewable chemical and synthetic biology industries. CST™ dextrose also has a lower CI score than dextrose produced with traditional wet-milling processes. Scaling Clean Sugar In 2022, we achieved food-grade certification, FSSC 22000, at our pilot CST™ production facility at our Innovation Center in York, Nebraska. Stringent quality management and a continuous improvement approach resulted in certification of our glucose and dextrose syrups at this facility, where production is ongoing. Following this external validation, in the third quarter 2022, we broke ground on a first-of-its.kind, full-scale CST™ production facility co-located with our Shenandoah, Iowa, bio-campus. Initial outputs are estimated at 200 million pounds of dextrose/glucose annually, with the ability to scale up to 500 million pounds upon further investment. This new CST™ facility will utilize a portion of the current biorefinery corn grind as a feedstock to produce its sugar. It will also return all remaining components of the corn — proteins, fibers, oils, unused starches and sugars — to the biorefinery. Scheduled to become operational by the first quarter of 2024, the Shenandoah CST™ facility is expected to produce 95% dextrose-equivalent (DE) and mid-DE products for shipment via rail and truck or eventually directly to over-the-fence partners. 2022 Breakthroughs • Achieving food grade certification at pilot CST™ facility • Breaking ground on first of its kind, commercial scale CST™ facility • Entering discussions with potential co location partners and customers From Biorefineries to Biocampuses: Leading a Biorevolution Renewable feedstock from the most abundant renewable carbon source available OUR PRODUCTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY: Produced cleanly, without harsh chemicals Lower CI than alternatives Renewable source of carbon Providing Lower-Carbon Alternatives Production of our new 95-DE and mid-DE products will expand opportunities for Green Plains and our customer partners across the food and beverage, synthetic biology and biochemical industries. Due to their lower CI compared with competitors' offerings, CST™-produced ingredients can help companies reduce their carbon footprints and gain a competitive edge in today’s sustainability-focused markets. CST™-produced carbohydrate (renewable carbon) feedstocks can deliver considerably lower CI scores than conventional fossil-derived feedstocks, such as crude oil and coal. Additionally, Green Plains' dry milling process produces bio-based glucose and dextrose at a dramatically lower CI than other available technologies, such as wet milling. A recent internal report shows this CI reduction compared to a wet mill to be anywhere from 20% to 48%, due to the unique advantages of FQT’s patented technology, which allows a dry mill to skip an energy-intensive portion of the sugar production process found on the front end of a wet mill. There are several reasons for this. First, CST™ is fundamentally focused on the production of sugars (glucose and dextrose), whereas wet mill technology focuses on the starch. Second, it is inherently simpler to separate the sugars from the other coproducts such as fiber, protein and renewable corn oil. Third, this innovative approach leads to more efficient processes and less equipment and energy use. Taken together, the use of CST™ equates to lower electrical, chemical and water usage per unit of production. Additionally, because CST™ uses some of the same processes as a dry mill ethanol facility, we can see further benefits in the production of low-CI sugar and low-CI ethanol. CARBON INTENSITY (KG CO2 E/MT DRY SUGAR) Dry Mill Clean Sugar Wet Mill Sugar Source: Recent internal report SUPPLYING A BURGEONING MARKET In North America, demand for bio-based glucose and dextrose derived from corn, one of the most abundant renewable carbon sources available, is high and expected to continue growing. Meeting this expanding demand will require new sources of glucose and dextrose, and Green Plains’ investment in CST™ strategically positions us to supply these markets. The bio-based glucose and dextrose industry, including bioplastics, biochemicals, renewable chemicals and synthetic biology, is diverse and evolving quickly. According to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, the global economic value of the biotechnology industry is estimated at $355 billion.5 Going forward, it is expected that large amounts of fermentable sugars will be required for next-generation biopolymer, biochemical, biofuel and food products.6 Even if the world were to recycle 100% of its products, there would still be a need for virgin materials to keep pace with overall economic growth.7 In addition, consumer preferences are increasing demand for responsibly produced ingredients and products. Consumers expect products to be derived from renewable sources and manufactured in a safe and non-invasive manner. By incorporating and driving the use of CST™ in our operations, Green Plains is well suited to help meet this demand; our process extracts sugar from corn using simple enzymes and mechanical separation, avoiding harsh chemicals traditionally used at wet mills. Replacing widely used, non-renewable petroleum-based feedstocks with renewable carbon feedstocks, such as bio-based glucose and dextrose derived from corn, can deliver far-reaching sustainability benefits. 5 Biotechnology Innovation Organization.

Bio Market Insights Feb 14, 2019 by Christophe Schilling, CEO, Genomatica BETTER PROTEINS, MORE RENEWABLE CORN OIL, EVEN LESS CARBON Green Plains is leveraging another of FQT’s patented tools, MSC™ technology, to achieve breakthroughs in higher-protein feed ingredients and valuable low-CI feedstock for the production of advanced biofuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In using the MSC™ system, we can achieve 50% or greater protein concentration, which combined with the high yeast component, is a valuable ingredient for pet, aquaculture, poultry, swine and dairy rations. This technology is crucial in our work to produce sustainable higher-protein feed ingredients, optimal starch utilization and more — all without expanding crop acreage. Additionally, the MSC™ system can increase the volume of renewable corn oil we are able to extract from the process by 50%. Renewable corn oil serves as a valuable feedstock for the production of advanced biofuels like renewable diesel and SAF. In 2022, Green Plains completed the construction of three additional MSC™ installations: Central City, Nebraska; Mount Vernon, Indiana; and Obion, Tennessee. These join our Shenandoah, Iowa, and Wood River, Nebraska, biorefineries already producing Ultra-High Protein. These five facilities account for more than half of our total 2023 production capacity. We also completed a Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Assessment of our Ultra-High Protein product, following the EU’s Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology.8 The results of the assessment include a CI from the Climate Change impact category of PEF in kilograms of CO2e per metric ton of Ultra-High Protein and utilize an economic allocation to easily compare our results to other common feed ingredients included in the Global Feed Life-Cycle Institute (GFLI) database. According to the PEF analysis, the CI of our Ultra-High Protein is 1,340 kg CO2e/ton UHP, which compares very favorably to many common alternative feed ingredients on the market today. Our protein products also have many functional characteristics that several alternatives, such as pea protein, lack, in addition to having a smaller carbon footprint. GFLI DATABASE SAMPLE (CRADLE-TO-GATE, ECONOMIC ALLOCATION IN USD)  LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT  Product Name  Climate Change (Kg CO2 e/Ton Product)  Corn DDGS at U.S. ethanol plant  655  Fishmeal at Norwegian fishmeal and oil production plant 1,041 Corn gluten meal at global wet mill plant 1,125 Ultra-High Protein at U.S. ethanol plant 1,340 Pea protein-concentrate, at German plant Soybean meal at Brazilian crushing plant 4,257 Soybean protein concentrate at Brazilian crushing plant 8 The LCA study is not a formal PEF assessment due to the absence of a suitable PEF Category Rule (CR) for our product. GREEN PLAINS INC. 2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 Breakthroughs • Used MSC™ systems to create higher protein animal feed, including aquaculture applications • Extracted 50% more renewable corn oil with operational MSC™ systems an important low CI feedstock for advanced biofuels such as renewable diesel and SAF • Added three new MSC™ installations, for a total of five, with annual capacity of 330,000 tons • Achieved over 50% of total production capacity powered by MSC™ in 2023 A CLEANER, HIGHER-QUALITY PROTEIN Green Plains’ protein products are plant-based, with key components of both corn and yeast. While other plant-based proteins rely on harsh chemicals and solvents to extract their product, Green Plains uses clean mechanical separation of fiber, fat and protein to produce consistent and nutritious Ultra-High Protein products. Corn has traditionally been considered an energy crop due to its starch content. However, by employing fermentation in conjunction with MSC™ technology, we are transforming corn into a versatile dual-purpose energy and protein resource. A BETTER NUTRITIONAL PROFILE Our MSC™ systems have achieved a baseline 50% crude protein with an optimum balance of inputs and yields. We have conducted further trials to achieve higher protein concentrations, with a proven path to commercial-scale concentrations above 60%. Additionally, through exclusive technology partnerships, we are leveraging a suite of biotechnology enhancements to achieve further improvements to the nutrition profile of our Ultra-High Protein. These improvements aim to provide feed formulators with the option to partially replace an even wider range of animal and plant-based proteins in an effort to increase their feed quality and reduce overall costs. However, this is not just a protein quantity story. It's also about greater digestibility and nutritional value. A key parameter for nutritional evaluation is digestibility, also known as the amount of nutrients absorbed by the animal being fed. FQT’s and Green Plains’ nutrition researchers have evaluated our protein products’ digestibility in several animal groups, including swine, poultry and fish. These studies have demonstrated that our amino acid digestibility is high (>87%) and consistent.9 Furthermore, Green Plains’ Innovation Center at York lab team demonstrated our products' high quantity of small peptides, which support its consistently high digestibility values. MSC™ technology’s unique separation and final drying process ensures that there is minimal protein quality degradation when the product is dried. The protein ingredient industry has been facing the perennial challenge of properly drying its product without causing heat damage and loss of digestibility. The gentle, non-contact drying used in the MSC™ system across the Green Plains production platform ensures consistent protein integrity. Another important nutrition consideration is the amino acid distribution of a protein. Nutritionists typically evaluate the levels of amino acids in proteins, such as lysine, methionine, valine and tryptophan, among others. Various research studies led by FQT, Green Plains and independent research institutes have confirmed the significant presence of these desirable amino acids in our products as well as our products' excellent digestibility coefficients. Finally, as nutritionists balance the needs of animals, they must consider the energy that feeds provide. A recent study concluded that the energy value of Green Plains' protein products is significantly higher than that of other common plant-based proteins.10 A YEAST GENERATOR The MSC™ process recovers much of the spent yeast, a valuable ingredient in animal nutrition that is generated in the fermentation process. The ethanol industry is a net producer of spent yeast, through the production of distillers grains and Ultra-High Protein, which is used to make animal feed. While the amount of yeast added to fermentation is measured and known, there is also an approximate 40-fold generation of yeast during the fermentation process. This yeast co-product of our Ultra-High Protein production helps reduce the carbon footprint of our feed 9 Source: Study conducted by Dr. Carl Parsons, University of Illinois 10 Nutritional value of ethanol coproduct evaluated for poultry, Bill Dudley-Cash, Feedstuffs Vol. 89, No. 11, November 6, 2017. operations, needing no additional arable land for its generation and by extension promoting biodiversity. The yeast component self-propagates in a closed-loop fermentation system within the relatively small footprint of a modern-day biorefinery. Approximately 24% of the dry matter of our high-protein product is spent brewer’s yeast. Further, yeast has been studied extensively in animal nutrition and is known to be a high-quality protein source with further immuno.stimulatory properties. Studies have shown that the use of yeast in animal diets results in high growth, feed intake and feed efficiency rates, with positive effects on robustness and health in fish.11,12 Similarly, yeast cell wall components and intracellular contents have been shown to have a valuable influence on health and immune competence. A recent study found that yeast as a protein source has a favorable amino acid profile, preferable taste and positive health effects.13 Experiments with yeast in diets for salmon concluded that yeast supports high-growth performance and improves fish health.14 Another study on the effect of yeast on gut health in Atlantic salmon found that yeast reduced inflammation in the gut, strengthened the gut barrier function and increased protection against pathogens.15 A SUPERIOR SCALABLE SOLUTION The global feed industry relies on consistent sources of ingredients to manufacture approximately 1.36 billion tons of compound feed.16 A novel protein must be available year-round depending on the animal species, demonstrate consistency in its nutritional parameters and come in sufficient volumes to support the complex, large-scale logistics and production infrastructure of the feed industry. Volume, regulatory compliance and resilience in the supply chain are hurdles that other novel protein technologies, such as insect protein and single-cell proteins, are having difficulty clearing. Using MSC™ technology, we are developing and commercializing a new protein alternative that can meet these criteria while also contributing to the circular economy — a major breakthrough in the global feed sector. We have a unique opportunity to produce a 50%+ plant-based protein at scale using our dry milling ethanol processes. A CIRCULAR ECONOMY STANDOUT MSC™ is making it possible for Green Plains to create high-quality animal feed ingredients from material that human beings would not consume rather than from additional valuable land or marine resources. Because they are coproducts of existing biofuel operations, Green Plains' Ultra-High Protein products exemplify the dynamics of a circular economy, in which the reuse and regeneration of materials or products eases impacts on limited natural resources. These high-value alternative protein products have considerable environmental benefits. A recent study revealed that the replacement of 10% of a common vegetable protein with MSC™ proteins is associated with a 19% and 14% reduction in CO2 emissions associated with poultry and salmon production, respectively.17 Feed accounts for the largest overall environmental impact of Atlantic salmon farming in all measured categories except eutrophication.18 POTENTIAL FOR AQUACULTURE MARKETS Aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. Green Plains has a unique opportunity to become a key supplier of high-quality, plant-based aquafeed for land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs), which normally feed fish to fish. Our Ultra-High Protein product is currently being tested in our aquafeed formulations and could potentially reduce demand for fishmeal in fish feed formulations, which in turn would help reduce the overfishing of the oceans. We believe the inclusion of our Ultra-High Protein product in aquafeed formulations could positively impact the fish in/fish out (FIFO) ratio of aquafeed, where FIFO is a measure of kilograms of whole wild fish for fishmeal production per every 1 kilogram of farmed fish production. 11 Overland & Skrede 2016, Yeast derived from lignocellulosic biomass as a sustainable feed resource for use in aquaculture, J.
